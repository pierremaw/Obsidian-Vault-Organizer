The tech is amazing.

AI Advancement is going to surprise many people.

When one performs a high abstraction on what humans do, all humans do is process and evaluate information patterns in data (sensory data), generate insights, and, perform actions that aid movement towards an aim.

When one performs a high abstraction on what present AI models do, it's very similar. These models process and evaluate information patterns in data (digital data), generate insights, and perform actions that aid movement towards an aim.

Very similar.

There are comments on present AI models as just fancy statistical predictors. And other comments on that there are some aspects to human intelligence that are embodied, and that language is insufficient.

These seem like coping mechanisms.

Words are important. Humans underestimate their importance as words are everywhere. Imagine your favourite website with no words. Just pictures. The site would not have much utility.

The AI models that are presently in production are going to seem not that impressive in one or two years. There is a high probability that in 10 years time, the world is remarkably different.
