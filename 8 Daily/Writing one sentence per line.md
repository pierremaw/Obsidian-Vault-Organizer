My advice to anyone who writes: Try writing one sentence per line. I’ve been doing it for twenty years, and it improved my writing more than anything else.

New sentence? Hit [Enter]. New line.

Not _publishing_ one sentence per line, no. **Write like this for your eyes only.** HTML or Markdown combine separate lines into one paragraph.

Why is it so useful?

### It helps you judge each sentence on its own.

We sometimes write sentences that don’t need to exist. Hidden in a paragraph, we might not notice. Standing on their own, we notice. Delete any sentence not worthy of its own line.
