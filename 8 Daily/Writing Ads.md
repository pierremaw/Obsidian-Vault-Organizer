# Create an information table for **your product**

The first column is for product **facts**.

The second column is for product **benefits**.

The third column is for **rating** a benefit’s relative importance (in comparison to other benefits).

A **product** **fact** is something that is objectively true for your product

A **product** **benefit** is what a **product fact** does for someone that uses it.

A **benefit rating** is on a 1-10 scale.

### **Example**

# Complete the information table for your product

## Write product facts

Evaluate your product for facts. Write those facts in the fact column.

## Write benefits

For each fact in the table, evaluate it from a consumer’s perspective, and generate an associated benefit.

## Rate benefits

For each benefit in the table, evaluate it from a consumer’s perspective, and generate a relative rating for it (1-10).
