For example, 5 nines of availability means an uptime of 99.999% of the time. Below are the downtimes expected per year depending on those 9s: -99% (two 9s): 877 hours -99.9% (three 9s): 8.8 hours -99.99%: 52.6 minutes -99.999%: 5.3 minutes I Redundancy The process of replicating parts of a system in an effort to make it more reliable.
