When correctly implemented, leader election guarantees that all nodes in the cluster know which one is the leader at any given time and can elect a new leader if the leader dies for whatever reason. I Consensus Algorithm Atype of complex algorithms used to have multiple entities agree on a single data value, like who the \"leader\" is amongst a group of machines. Two popular consensus algorithms are Paxos and Raft. 1 Paxos & Raft Two consensus algorithms that, when implemented correctly, allow for the synchronization of certain operations, even in a distributed setting. | etea % Etcd is a strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that's often used to implement leader election in a system.
