A data structure that stores key-value pairs

## Creating a Hash Table

To create a hash table in JavaScript, you can use an object literal syntax:

```
const hashTable = {};
```

This creates an empty hash table that can be populated with key-value pairs.

## Adding Key-Value Pairs

To add a key-value pair to a hash table, you can use the bracket notation to assign a value to a key:
```
hashTable["key"] = "value";
```

This assigns the value "value" to the key "key" in the hash table. You can also use the dot notation to assign a value to a key:

```
`hashTable.key = "value";`
```

This does the same thing as the bracket notation.

## Retrieving Values

To retrieve a value from a hash table, you can use the bracket notation to access the value associated with a key:

```
`const value = hashTable["key"];`
```

This assigns the value associated with the key "key" to the variable `value`. You can also use the dot notation to access the value:

```
const value = hashTable.key;
```

This does the same thing as the bracket notation.
