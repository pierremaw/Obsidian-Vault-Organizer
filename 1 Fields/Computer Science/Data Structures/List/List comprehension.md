A concise way to create a list

```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]

```

Where:

- `expression` is the operation performed on the item in the iterable
- `item` is the variable that represents each element in the iterable
- `iterable` is the existing iterable (list, tuple, dictionary, etc.) used to create the new list
- `condition` (optional) is a filtering expression used to select only certain elements in the iterable
