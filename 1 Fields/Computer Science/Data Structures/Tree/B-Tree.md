A B-tree is a tree data structure that is optimized for disk access. It is used in file systems and databases to store and retrieve data efficiently. B-trees are also used in network routing protocols.

# Properties

B-trees have several important properties:

-   Each node can have multiple children
-   Each node contains a range of keys that are sorted in order
-   All leaf nodes are at the same level

# Operations

The most common operations on a B-tree are:

-   Searching: finding a particular key in the tree
-   Insertion: adding a new key to the tree
-   Deletion: removing a key from the tree

# Applications

B-trees are used in a wide variety of applications, including:

-   File systems: B-trees are used to store and retrieve data efficiently
-   Databases: B-trees are used to store indexes and table data
-   Network routing protocols: B-trees are used to store and route IP addresses
