A weighted graph is a graph in which a weight is assigned to each edge. The weight represents a value or cost associated with traversing that edge.

**Most important concept**: In a weighted graph, the shortest path between two nodes is not necessarily the path with the fewest number of edges, but the path with the smallest total weight.
