Data Types are used to classify data and define how it is useable.

There are two main types of data types in OOP: primitive data types and object data types.

Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in OOP. They include things like integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Object data types are more complex and can be used to represent real-world objects. They are created by defining a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects.
