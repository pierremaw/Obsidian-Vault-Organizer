Description: A mathematical process to transform data into a fixed-length digital fingerprint for secure data indexing and integrity verification.

Hashing is a cryptographic technique that transforms a piece of data into a fixed-length digital fingerprint using a mathematical algorithm. This digital fingerprint, also known as a hash, is used for secure data indexing and integrity verification. Hashing algorithms ensure that even a small change in the input data results in a significantly different hash, making it an effective method to detect tampering or corruption of data. Hashing is widely used in various security-sensitive applications, including password storage, digital signatures, and data integrity verification.
