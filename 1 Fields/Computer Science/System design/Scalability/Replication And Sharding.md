A system's performance is often only as good as its database's; optimize the latter, and watch as the former improves in tandem!

# Replication
The act of duplicating the data from one database server to others. This is sometimes used to increase the redundancy of your system and tolerate regional failures for instances. Other times you can use replication to move data closer to your clients, thus decreasing the latency of accessing specific data.

# Sharding
Sometimes called **data partitioning**, sharding is the act of splitting a database intwo two or more pieces called **shards** and is typically done to increase the throughput of your database
