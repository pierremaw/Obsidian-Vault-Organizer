**System design:** A process that involves defining architecture, interfaces, and data

- **Architecture**: Understand and plan the system's setup and organization
    - **Microservices**: Break the system into small, independent, and scalable services
    - **Monolithic**: Develop the system as a single unit
    - **Serverless**: Utilize on-demand, event-driven computing resources
    - **SOA**: Design based on service-oriented architecture principles

- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can grow and handle increased load
    - **Horizontal scaling**: Add more machines to a system
    - **Vertical scaling**: Increase the capacity of existing machines

- **Availability**: Design the system to be continuously operational
    - **Redundancy**: Duplicate critical components to prevent single points of failure
    - **Failover**: Automatically switch to a backup system in case of failure
    - **Load balancing**: Distribute workload across multiple resources

- **Performance**: Optimize the system for fast and efficient operation
    - **Caching**: Store and reuse frequently-used data or computation results
    - **Database indexing**: Improve database query performance
    - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute content to reduce latency

- **Security**: Protect the system and its data from unauthorized access and threats
    - **Authentication**: Verify the identity of users or systems
    - **Authorization**: Determine and enforce access permissions
    - **Encryption**: Secure data transmission and storage
    - **Auditing**: Monitor and log system activity for analysis and compliance

- **Data Management**: Handle data storage, retrieval, and consistency
    - **Database types**: Choose the appropriate database technology
        - **Relational**: SQL databases for structured data
        - **NoSQL**: Non-relational databases for flexible data models
    - **Data partitioning**: Distribute data across multiple storage nodes
    - **Consistency**: Ensure data integrity across the system
        - **Eventual consistency**: Accept temporary inconsistencies for increased performance
        - **Strong consistency**: Enforce immediate consistency at the cost of performance

- **API Design**: Define interfaces for communication between system components
    - **REST**: Utilize Representational State Transfer principles
    - **GraphQL**: Query language for flexible data retrieval
    - **gRPC**: High-performance Remote Procedure Call framework
    - **Versioning**: Manage changes to API contracts

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Track system health and performance
    - **Metrics**: Collect and analyze performance indicators
    - **Alerting**: Notify responsible parties of issues
    - **Tracing**: Investigate and diagnose system behavior

- **Deployment**: Automate and streamline system updates
    - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and test code changes
    - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploy changes to production
    - **Infrastructure as Code (IAC)**: Manage infrastructure configuration in version-controlled code
