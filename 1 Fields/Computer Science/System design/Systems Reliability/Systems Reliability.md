Compact description: The ability of a system to perform its intended function accurately and consistently.

Reliability refers to the ability of a system to perform its intended function accurately and consistently over time. A reliable system is one that is dependable and consistently performs as expected, even in adverse conditions. For example, a power grid that is reliable will consistently deliver electricity to homes and businesses without interruption. Similarly, a communication network that is reliable will consistently deliver messages without errors or delays. A reliable system is important for maintaining safety, security, and for avoiding costly downtime or other disruptions. 

A system's reliability is a key aspect of its overall performance and is usually a primary concern for engineers, designers, and managers when designing, building, and maintaining complex systems.
