Rate limiting is a way to control the amount of traffic that is allowed to flow into a website or a computer program. It helps make sure that the website or program doesn't get too busy and slow down, by limiting the amount of requests it gets at once. Think of it like a traffic light that controls how many cars can go through a road at once. It helps prevent traffic jams and makes sure that everyone gets a fair turn to use the website or program.
