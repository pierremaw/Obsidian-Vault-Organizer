-   Peer-to-Peer Networks are a type of computer network
-   In a P2P network, each computer can work together and share information directly with each other
-   This means that each computer can share files, like music or movies, with each other
-   This type of network is like a group of friends sharing their toys
-   There is no one computer that controls everything
-   This allows for more efficient use of resources
-   The network can handle large amounts of data being shared at once.

Think of it like this: Imagine you and your friends all have different toys, and you can play with each other's toys whenever you want, without having to ask permission from one person. That's how P2P networks work!
