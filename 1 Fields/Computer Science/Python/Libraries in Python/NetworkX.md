- **NetworkX**: A Python package for creating and manipulating graphs and networks
- **Nodes**: The entities in a graph that can be anything (e.g., text, images, XML records)
- **Edges**: The connections between nodes that can hold arbitrary data (e.g., weights, time-series)
- **Graph**: A data structure that represents a network of nodes and edges
- **Algorithms**: Many standard graph algorithms are implemented in networkx, such as shortest path, clustering, centrality, etc.
- **Drawing**: Networkx provides functions for drawing graphs using matplotlib or other libraries
