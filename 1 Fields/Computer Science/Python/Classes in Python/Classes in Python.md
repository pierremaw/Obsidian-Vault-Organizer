| Classes are blueprints for creating objects¹³ | Classes define the properties and methods of objects¹⁴ | Classes can be used to model real-world entities or abstract concepts with data and functionality³⁴ |
| Classes are objects themselves¹ | Classes can have attributes and methods of their own, such as `__init__`, `__str__`, or `__name__`¹² | Classes can be used to import and rename modules, create metaclasses, or implement multiple inheritance¹² |
| Classes have a namespace and a scope¹| Classes create a new local namespace where all their attributes are defined. Attributes may be accessed using dot notation or via self parameter¹. Class variables are shared by all instances of a class; instance variables are unique to each instance².| Classes can be used to encapsulate data and avoid name clashes. Class variables can be used to store constants or default values; instance variables can be used to store individual state information².|
| Classes support inheritance and polymorphism¹| Classes can inherit attributes and methods from one or more base classes using the subclass mechanism. Subclasses can override or extend the behavior of their base classes. A method can call the method of a base class with the same name using super() function¹. Polymorphism means that different classes can have methods with the same name but different implementations.[2]|Classes can be used to create hierarchies of related types that share common features but also have specific differences. Inheritance allows code reuse and modularity; polymorphism allows flexibility and generality.[2]|
