Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python that allows developers to write efficient and comprehensive test suites.

# pytest fixtures

Fixtures provide a way to set up preconditions for tests to run.

## What Are Fixtures?

Fixtures are functions that run before each test and provide a set of data or objects that are required for the test to run. Fixtures can be used to set up database connections, create test data, or perform other necessary setup tasks.
