To merge branches locally, use `git checkout`to switch to the branch you want to merge into. This branch is typically the _main_ branch. Next, use `git merge`and specify the name of the other branch to bring into this branch. This example merges the _jeff/feature1_ branch into the _main_ branch. Note that this is a **fast-forward** merge.
