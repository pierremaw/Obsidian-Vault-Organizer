[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)Â is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, does smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and a lot more. Next.js is able to heavily optimize your websites by only loading what you need on-demand instead of having to load up the entire site at the beginning. It also allows for a much better experience with creating API routes thanks to its file-system routing feature, it optimizes images, it has Typescript support, it helps with i18n API internationalized routing, and a lot more.
