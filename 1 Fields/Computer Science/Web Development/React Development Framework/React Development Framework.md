- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.
  - **Components**: Reusable and self-contained building blocks that define the UI and behavior of a React application.
    - **Functional components**: Stateless components that define the UI without maintaining any internal state.
    - **Class components**: Components with built-in state management and lifecycle methods for more complex behavior.
  - **JSX**: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows mixing of HTML-like syntax and JavaScript within React components.
- **State management**: The process of handling data and state changes within a React application.
  - **Local state**: Component-specific state that is managed and updated within the component itself.
  - **Global state**: Application-wide state that can be accessed and manipulated by multiple components.
    - **Context API**: A built-in React mechanism for managing global state without the need for external libraries.
    - **Redux**: A popular external library for managing global state in a React application.
- **Lifecycle**: The different phases a React component goes through during its existence.
  - **Mounting**: The process of creating and inserting a component into the DOM.
  - **Updating**: The process of re-rendering a component in response to changes in state or props.
  - **Unmounting**: The process of removing a component from the DOM and cleaning up any resources it used.
- **Performance optimization**: Techniques to improve the speed and efficiency of a React application.
  - **Virtual DOM**: A lightweight in-memory representation of the actual DOM that allows React to perform efficient updates.
  - **React.memo**: A higher-order function that memoizes a functional component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - **shouldComponentUpdate**: A lifecycle method in class components that allows for optimization by determining whether a component should re-render.
- **Ecosystem**: A collection of tools, libraries, and resources that support and extend the capabilities of React.
  - **React Router**: A popular library for handling client-side routing in React applications.
  - **Styled-components**: A library that allows developers to write CSS within JavaScript for styling React components.
  - **Create React App**: A command-line tool for quickly setting up a new React project with a pre-configured build system.


### React in Web 3

The most popular web development framework is React with a wide margin compared to Vue.js. React was originally developed by the Facebook team, but was open-sourced early on and now it has thousands of contributors and many full-time maintainers who are constantly pushing the framework forward.

Most of the user interfaces for blockchain applications are programmed using React and there are many React component libraries that you can reuse from the community to perform common tasks like logging with an Ethereum wallet, switching networks, and also so-called React hooks libraries (i.e.Â [eth-hooks](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/eth-hooks)) which let you fetch different data like balance, block number, prices and more.
