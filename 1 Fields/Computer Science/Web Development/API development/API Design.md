| Feature       | Description                                                               |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application Programming Interface | APIs are a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software.   |
| Interface                         | APIs act as an interface between different software applications.         |
| Resource-Based                    | APIs are typically designed around resources like data or functionality.  |
| RESTful                           | REST is a common architectural style for designing APIs.                  |
| Versioning                        | APIs must be versioned to allow for changes and updates.                  |
| Documentation                     | APIs must be well-documented for ease of use and understanding.           |
| User Experience                   | APIs must provide a good user experience for developers using them.       |
| Simplicity                        | APIs should be simple and easy to use to encourage adoption.              |
| Consistency                       | APIs should be consistent in their design and behavior.                   |
| Flexibility                       | APIs should be flexible to accommodate different use cases and scenarios. |
| Security                          | APIs must be secured to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.            |
| Testing                           | APIs must be thoroughly tested for reliability and performance.           |
| Error Handling                    | APIs must handle errors and exceptions gracefully.                        |
| Rate Limiting                     | APIs may need to implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or overload.    |
| Data Formats                      | APIs may support different data formats like JSON or XML.                 |
| HATEOAS                           | HATEOAS is a design principle that allows for self-describing APIs.       |
| Hypermedia                        | Hypermedia is a feature that allows for navigation between API resources. |
| API Gateways                      | API gateways can be used for routing and managing API requests.           |
