[[API (Application Programming Interface)]] development is a process where the main aim is to enable different systems to communicate and interact with each other.

### Architecture
1. [[API endpoints]]
	- Endpoints are specific locations of an API where a particular service or functionality can be accessed, each with a unique URL. 
2. [[HTTP methods]]
	- HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, are used to specify the type of action that should be performed on the endpoint. 
3. Authentication & Authorization
	- Authentication and authorization ensures that only authorized users can access the data and perform certain actions.

### Uses

APIs can be used for various purposes, such as:

-   Retrieving and updating data from a database
-   Accessing and interacting with third-party services
-   Automating workflows and tasks
-   Building and integrating mobile and web applications
-   And many more.
