___

## **Front End**
  - **HTML**: Structure and content of the web page
    - Use of semantic elements (header, footer, article, section)
    - Accessibility best practices (alt tags, ARIA roles)

  - **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web page
    - Responsive design (media queries, mobile-first approach)
    - CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
    - CSS preprocessors (Sass, LESS)

  - **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic content
    - ES6+ features (arrow functions, classes, modules)
    - JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
    - State management libraries (Redux, Vuex)

## **App**
  - **Native App**: Platform-specific application development
    - iOS development (Swift, Objective-C)
    - Android development (Java, Kotlin)
    - App stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store)

  - **Hybrid App**: Cross-platform application development
    - Frameworks (React Native, Flutter, Ionic)
    - Code sharing between platforms
    - Device features integration (camera, geolocation)

  - **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Web-based application with native-like features
    - Service workers for offline support
    - App manifest for home screen installation
    - Performance optimization techniques (caching, code splitting)

## **Back End**
  - **Server**: Handle incoming requests and serve responses
    - Popular server languages (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java)
    - Server frameworks (Express, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring)

  - **API**: Communication between front end and back end
    - RESTful API design (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - GraphQL API design
    - API documentation tools (Swagger, Postman)

  - **Database**: Store and manage data
    - SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
    - NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis)
    - ORMs and query builders (Sequelize, Mongoose, ActiveRecord)

## **Development Tools and Practices**
  - **Version Control**: Track code changes and collaborate with others
    - Git (commit, branch, merge)
    - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

  - **Testing**: Ensure code quality and prevent regressions
    - Unit testing (Jest, Mocha, Jasmine)
    - Integration testing
    - End-to-end testing (Cypress, Selenium)

  - **Deployment**: Publish the website on the internet
    - Hosting providers (Netlify, Vercel, Heroku)
    - Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
    - Domain registration and SSL certificates
