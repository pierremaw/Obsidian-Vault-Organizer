Minimalistic web framework for building apps.

Note: Flask has a built-in web server. When your writing your flask app locally and running it, your essentially turning your computer into a web server that can then host your flask app. Now the web server provided by flask is very basic and not secure which is why they mention deploying flask in production should be on an actual production grade web server software like Apache or nginx.
