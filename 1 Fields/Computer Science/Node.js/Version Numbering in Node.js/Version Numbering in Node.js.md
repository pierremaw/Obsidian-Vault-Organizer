In a Node.js project's `package.json` file, `"version": "1.0.0"` specifies the initial version number for the project.

The version number is typically represented using the [semver](https://semver.org/) (Semantic Versioning) format, which consists of three numbers separated by periods: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

-   The `MAJOR` version is incremented when there are significant changes that may break backward compatibility.
-   The `MINOR` version is incremented when new functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
-   The `PATCH` version is incremented when bugs or issues are fixed in a backward-compatible manner.

For example, if a project has version `1.0.0`, then the next backward-compatible release might be `1.1.0` (with new features), and the next release with only bug fixes might be `1.0.1`.
