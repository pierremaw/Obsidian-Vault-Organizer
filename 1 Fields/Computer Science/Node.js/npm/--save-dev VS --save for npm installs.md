# --save-dev 

```
npm install --save-dev ethers.js
```

Adding a -dev flag signals that the package should only be used for development environments.

# --save (optional)

```
npm install --save ethers.js
```

The `--save` option is used to install production dependencies that are required for the application to run in production. 

As of [npm 5.0.0](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500), installed modules are added as a dependency by default, so the `--save` option is no longer needed.
