`   package-lock.json` is a file generated by the npm package manager that describes the exact version of each installed package in your project, along with their dependencies. It serves as a deterministic record of the state of your project's dependencies, ensuring that anyone who installs the project gets the exact same versions of the packages.

When you run `npm install` or `npm ci` to install packages for your project, npm reads the `package.json` file to determine which packages to install, and then creates or updates the `package-lock.json` file to reflect the exact versions of the packages that were installed. If you later run `npm install` or `npm ci` again, npm will use the `package-lock.json` file to install the exact same versions of the packages, unless the `package.json` file has been modified to specify different version ranges or dependencies.

It's worth noting that the `package-lock.json` file is only generated for projects that use npm 5 or later.
