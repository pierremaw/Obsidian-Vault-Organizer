| Testing                           | A software testing process used to verify that a program or application works as expected.                                                                                                                    |
| Test Frameworks                   | Libraries and tools that provide a set of methods for creating and running tests. Popular test frameworks for Node.js include Mocha, Jest, and Ava.                                                           |
| Assertion Libraries               | Libraries that provide methods for defining and checking expected outcomes of tests. Examples include Chai and Should.js.                                                                                     |
| Mocking Libraries                 | Libraries that provide the ability to simulate complex dependencies, isolate code, and replace real dependencies with testable ones. Examples include Sinon and Jest.                                         |
| Test Runners                      | Tools that automate the process of running tests and reporting results. Examples include Mocha, Jest, and Karma.                                                                                              |
| Test Coverage                     | The measurement of how much of a program's code is exercised by a test suite. Tools like Istanbul and nyc can be used to generate test coverage reports in Node.js.                                           |
| Continuous Integration (CI)       | The practice of automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes to a shared repository. CI tools like Travis CI and Jenkins can be used to automate the testing process for Node.js applications. |
| Test-Driven Development (TDD)     | A development methodology where tests are written before the code they are testing.                                                                                                                           |
| Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) | A development methodology that focuses on describing the behavior of an application in a human-readable format. Tools like Mocha and Cucumber can be used to implement BDD in Node.js.                        |
