**Chai**: assertion library for Node.js that creates test assertions and expectations.

```
/// To use chai, ensure this is in your test.js file ///

const { expect } = require("chai")
```

| Feature                          | Description                                                                                                                                           |

| Assertion Styles                 | Chai supports three different assertion styles: should, expect, and assert. Each style has a slightly different syntax and usage.                     |
| Chainable API                    | Chai provides a chainable API, which allows for creating expressive assertions that read like natural language.                                       |
| Plugin Architecture              | Chai supports a plugin architecture, allowing developers to extend and customize the library for their specific needs.                                |
| Browser Support                  | Chai can be used in both Node.js and browser environments.                                                                                            |
| Assertions                       | Chai provides a wide range of built-in assertions for testing various types of data, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.       |
| Custom Assertions                | Developers can create their own custom assertions by extending the library with new methods.                                                          |
| Asynchronous Assertions          | Chai supports asynchronous assertions, allowing for testing code that uses Promises or other asynchronous patterns.                                   |
| Chai Spies                       | Chai provides a spying mechanism called Chai Spies, which can be used to test function calls and side effects.                                        |
| Integration with Test Frameworks | Chai can be integrated with popular test frameworks like Mocha, Jasmine, and Jest, allowing for seamless integration with existing testing workflows. |
