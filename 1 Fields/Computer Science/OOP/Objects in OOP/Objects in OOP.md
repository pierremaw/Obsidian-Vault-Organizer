A class instance.

When an object is created from a class, it is said to be instantiated. The object can then be manipulated using its methods & variables..

> When an object is instantiated, it's somewhat like a factory object being created from a blueprint.

In OOP, objects can also interact with each other. For example, one object might call a method on another object to get or set a value. This allows for complex behaviors to be modeled in code, with objects representing real-world entities and interactions.
