Prometheus is a system that helps us keep an eye on other systems and services. It belongs to a bigger field called IT Operations and Management, which is all about making sure the things that run our computers and the internet are running smoothly.

One of the important things in IT Operations and Management is monitoring and observability, which means making sure we know what's happening with all the systems and services we use. One of the ways we do this is by keeping track of time-series data, which is information that changes over time, like how much memory a computer is using or how many people are visiting a website.

Prometheus is a special tool for monitoring time-series data. It works by storing data about the systems and services it's watching, and then letting us ask questions about that data. For example, we might ask Prometheus how much memory a computer has used in the last hour, and it will show us a graph of the answer. This way, we can see what's going on with the systems and services we care about, and make sure they're running the way they should be.
