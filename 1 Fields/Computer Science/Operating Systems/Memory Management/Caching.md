Caching is a technique for temporarily storing frequently used data in a fast-access memory location to speed up subsequent accesses to the data. By reducing the number of disk or network accesses required, caching can significantly improve system performance. It is widely used in computer systems, networks, and web applications to improve performance and responsiveness.
