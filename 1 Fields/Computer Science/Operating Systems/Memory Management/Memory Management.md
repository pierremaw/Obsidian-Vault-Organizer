Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating the use of memory in a computer system. It involves allocating memory to processes, tracking which parts of memory are being used, and freeing up memory that is no longer needed. Effective memory management is critical to ensuring the stability and performance of an operating system and the applications it runs.
