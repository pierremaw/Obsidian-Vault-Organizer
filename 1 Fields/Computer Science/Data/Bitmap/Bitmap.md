- A **sequence of bits** (0s and 1s) that represents data
- Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a **unit** of data, such as a pixel, a value, or a condition
- Bitmaps can be used to store **images**, **indexes**, **masks**, and other types of data
- Bitmaps can be **compressed** to reduce the space required to store them
- Bitmaps can be manipulated using **bitwise operations**, such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.
- Bitmaps can be converted to other data formats, such as **strings**, **numbers**, or **arrays**
- Bitmaps can be visualized using **hexadecimal** or **binary** notation
