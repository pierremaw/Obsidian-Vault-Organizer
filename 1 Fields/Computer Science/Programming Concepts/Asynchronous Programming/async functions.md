Parallel processing for faster execution

- **Async functions**: functions that return a promise and can use await expressions
- **Promise**: an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation
- **Await**: a keyword that pauses the execution of an async function until a promise is fulfilled or rejected
- **Try/catch**: a statement that allows handling errors in async functions by catching rejected promises
- **Async/await syntax**: a syntactic sugar that makes writing and reading async functions easier and cleaner
- **Parallel vs sequential execution**: a choice of how to run multiple async functions depending on whether they depend on each other or not
