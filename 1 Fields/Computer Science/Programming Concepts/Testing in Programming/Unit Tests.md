|       | Unit Tests                                                                                                                                              |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition | Automated tests that verify the functionality of individual code components or units.                                                                   |
| Purpose    | Ensure that each unit of code works as expected and meets design specifications.                                                                        |
| Components | Test cases, assertions, setup, teardown, and other testing tools.                                                                                       |
| Types      | White-box testing, black-box testing, and gray-box testing.                                                                                             |
| Tools      | Testing frameworks such as Mocha, Jest, and Jasmine, along with mocking libraries and assertion libraries.                                              |
| Syntax     | Tests are written in the same programming language as the code being tested, using a specific testing framework.                                        |
| Examples   | Testing individual functions or methods, verifying input and output values, testing edge cases, and testing error handling.                             |
| Benefits   | Provides early detection and prevention of bugs and errors, improves code quality and maintainability, and helps ensure the code functions as intended. |
