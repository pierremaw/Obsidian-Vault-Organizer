- **Q notation**: A method to represent floating-point numbers using a fixed number of bits.
  - **Quantization**: The process of converting continuous values into discrete representations.
    - **Quantization error**: The difference between the quantized value and the original continuous value.
  - **Fixed-point arithmetic**: An alternative to floating-point arithmetic that represents numbers as integers with an implied fixed scaling factor.

- **Q96**: A specific instance of Q notation with 96 bits of precision.
  - **Range**: The set of numbers that can be represented using Q96 notation.
    - **Minimum value**: The smallest number that can be represented using Q96 notation.
    - **Maximum value**: The largest number that can be represented using Q96 notation.
  - **Precision**: The degree of accuracy with which numbers can be represented using Q96 notation.
    - **Fractional part**: The portion of the Q96 number that represents the digits after the decimal point.
    - **Integer part**: The portion of the Q96 number that represents the digits before the decimal point.
  - **Conversion**: The process of converting a number from another representation (e.g., floating-point) to Q96 notation.
    - **Rounding**: The method used to approximate a number to the closest representable value in Q96 notation.

- **Applications**: The use cases and scenarios where Q notation, including Q96, is beneficial.
  - **Embedded systems**: Systems with limited resources where Q notation can provide efficient numerical representations.
  - **Digital signal processing**: The analysis and manipulation of signals using digital techniques, where Q notation can help manage quantization errors and simplify calculations.
