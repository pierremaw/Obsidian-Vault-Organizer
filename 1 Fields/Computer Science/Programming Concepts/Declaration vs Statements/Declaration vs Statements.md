# Declarations

A declaration is a statement that introduces a new identifier into the program, such as a variable or function. Declarations provide information about the identifier, such as its type, visibility, and scope. They do not actually perform any computation or modify the state of the program.

For example, in Java, the following code declares a variable named `x` of type `int`:

```
int x;
```

This is a declaration statement that introduces the new variable `x` into the program.

# Statements

A statement, on the other hand, is a unit of code that performs a specific action or produces a result. Statements can include assignments, control structures (like if-else statements or loops), and function calls.

For example, in Java, the following code is a statement that assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`:

```
x = 5;
```

This statement modifies the value of the variable `x` and changes the state of the program.

In summary, declarations introduce new identifiers into a program and provide information about them, while statements perform actions and modify the program's state. While declarations are a type of statement, not all statements are declarations.
