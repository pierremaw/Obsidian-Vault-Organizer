**GraphQL**: A query language for APIs and runtime for executing queries.

1. **Overview**
   * **Purpose**: Provide a flexible and efficient API for requesting and updating data
   * **Created by**: Facebook in 2012
   * **Released as open-source**: 2015
   * **Language agnostic**: Can be implemented in any programming language

2. **Core Concepts**
   * **Schema**: The blueprint of a GraphQL API, defining the types and their relationships
      * **Object types**: Define entities and their fields
      * **Query type**: Define the entry points for querying data
      * **Mutation type**: Define the entry points for updating data
   * **Queries**: Request specific data from the server
      * **Fields**: Define which properties of an entity to fetch
      * **Arguments**: Filter data based on certain criteria
      * **Aliases**: Rename fields in the response
   * **Mutations**: Modify data on the server
      * **Create**: Add new data to the server
      * **Update**: Modify existing data on the server
      * **Delete**: Remove data from the server
   * **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates when data changes
   * **Fragments**: Reusable pieces of a query or mutation

3. **Advantages**
   * **Flexibility**: Clients request only the data they need
   * **Efficiency**: Reduced over-fetching and under-fetching of data
   * **Strongly-typed**: Clear and precise contracts between clients and servers
   * **Introspection**: Clients can discover the schema at runtime

4. **Tools and Libraries**
   * **GraphiQL**: An in-browser IDE for exploring GraphQL
   * **Apollo**: A popular suite of GraphQL tools for various platforms
   * **Relay**: A JavaScript framework for building data-driven React applications
   * **GraphQL-Ruby**: A Ruby implementation of GraphQL

5. **Security and Performance**
   * **Authentication**: Use existing authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth
   * **Authorization**: Define access control rules within the schema
   * **Rate limiting**: Limit the number of queries or their complexity
   * **Caching**: Improve performance by caching query results

6. **Use Cases**
   * **Single-page applications**: Efficiently request data for complex UIs
   * **Mobile applications**: Minimize bandwidth usage and improve responsiveness
   * **Microservices**: Consolidate multiple data sources into a single API

7. **Best Practices**
   * **Modularize schema**: Break the schema into smaller, more manageable parts
   * **Use descriptive names**: Make the schema easy to understand and maintain
   * **Error handling**: Provide meaningful error messages and status codes
   * **Deprecate fields**: Mark fields as deprecated when phasing them out
