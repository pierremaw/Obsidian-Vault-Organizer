| Abstraction   | Hiding the unnecessary details and complexity                             | Simplifies the design and implementation                 |
| Cohesion      | The degree of relatedness or similarity among the elements of a component | High cohesion enhances readability and understandability |
| Coupling      | The degree of interdependence or reliance among components                | Low coupling facilitates modularity and maintainability  |
| Encapsulation | Bundling together the data and behavior of a component                    | Protects the integrity and consistency of the data       |
| Modularity    | Breaking down a system into smaller components                            | Enhances reusability, testability, and readability       |
| Polymorphism  | The ability of a component to take different forms or behaviors           | Enables flexibility and extensibility                    |
