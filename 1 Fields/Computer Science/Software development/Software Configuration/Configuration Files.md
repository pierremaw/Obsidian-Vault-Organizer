| Format                      | Configuration files have different formats, such as YAML, JSON, INI, or XML, which determine the structure and syntax of the file.                                                                                                                                              |
| Parameters                  | Configuration files contain parameters, which are variables that store specific values. These values can be modified to customize the behavior of the application.                                                                                                              |
| Sections                    | Configuration files may have sections, which are used to group related parameters. Sections are often denoted by headers within the file.                                                                                                                                       |
| Environment variables       | Configuration files may reference environment variables, which are variables that are set outside the application, often by the operating system or system administrator. Environment variables are commonly used to store sensitive information such as API keys or passwords. |
