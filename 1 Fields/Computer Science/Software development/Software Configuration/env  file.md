The `.env` file is a configuration file that is used to store environment variables in a project.

The format of a `.env` file is:
```
KEY1=VALUE1
KEY2=VALUE2
```
Often times you'll see the values in quotes. This is only necessary if your value has a space in it like `"my value"`. Whitespace surrounding the value is not an issue in a `.env` file.
