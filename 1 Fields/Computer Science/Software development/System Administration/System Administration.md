Imagine you have a big toy box filled with lots of toys. You have to make sure the toys are clean and organized so you can easily find the one you want to play with. This is what system administrators do for computers. They take care of the computer toys, make sure they are running smoothly, and fix them if something is not working right. Just like you need to keep your toy box clean and organized, system administrators need to keep the computer system organized, running efficiently, and fixing any problems that may arise.
