Imagine you have a computer and you want to make sure everything is working okay. You want to know what the computer has been doing and if there are any problems. This is where logging and monitoring come in. Logging is like writing down what the computer has been doing so you can look back at it later. Monitoring is like keeping an eye on the computer to make sure everything is okay. If there is a problem, you will be able to see it right away and fix it. This helps keep your computer running smoothly.
