| Destructuring assignment | A syntax that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables.                                                         |
| Array destructuring      | You can use destructuring to extract values from an array and assign them to individual variables. For example:Â `let [a, b] = [1, 2];`                                                                                                                    |
| Object destructuring     | You can use destructuring to extract properties from an object and assign them to individual variables.                                                                                                                   |
| Default values           | You can set default values for variables when using destructuring assignment.                                                                            |
| Renaming variables       | You can rename variables during destructuring assignment using the : syntax.                                                                             |
| Nested destructuring     | You can use destructuring assignment on nested arrays and objects.                                                                                       |
| Rest operator            | The rest operator (...) allows you to assign the remaining elements of an array to a variable.                                                           |
| Destructuring parameters | You can use destructuring assignment with function parameters.                                                                                           |
| Applications             | Destructuring assignment is commonly used for: extracting values from function returns, handling complex data structures, and making code more readable. |
| Compatibility            | Destructuring assignment is compatible with ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and newer versions of JavaScript.                                                      |
