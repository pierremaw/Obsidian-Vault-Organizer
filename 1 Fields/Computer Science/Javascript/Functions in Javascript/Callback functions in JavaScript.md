A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function.

| Definition               | A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed inside that function.                                                                                       |
| Asynchronous programming | Callback functions are an important tool for asynchronous programming in JavaScript, allowing developers to write non-blocking code that can handle events or perform tasks in the background.                  |
| Error handling           | Callback functions are often used to handle errors that occur during asynchronous operations. If an error occurs, the callback function can be called with an error object that describes the error.            |
| Event handling           | Callback functions are commonly used to handle events in JavaScript. For example, a click event on a button can be handled using a callback function that is executed when the button is clicked.               |
| Higher-order functions   | Callback functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments. This allows for greater flexibility and reusability in code.              |
| Nesting and chaining     | Callback functions can be nested and chained together to perform multiple asynchronous operations in sequence. However, this can lead to code that is difficult to read and maintain, known as "callback hell." |
| Library support          | Callback functions are supported by many JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including Node.js, jQuery, and React.                                                                                             |
| ES6 alternatives         | With the introduction of ES6, newer alternatives to callback functions have emerged, such as promises and async/await syntax, which provide cleaner and more concise ways of handling asynchronous code.        |
