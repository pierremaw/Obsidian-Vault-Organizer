| Function keyword    | Define a function with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses                                                          | Declares a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value                |
| Function parameters | Specifies the input of the function inside parentheses, separated by commas                             | Passes arguments to the function when it is called                                                   |
| Function body       | Contains the code to be executed by the function inside curly braces                                    | Defines the logic and behavior of the function                                                       |
| Function return     | Ends the execution of the function and returns an output with the return keyword                        | Provides an output that has some obvious relationship with the input                                 |
| Function object     | Treats functions as first-class objects that can have properties and methods just like any other object | Enables functions to be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions |
