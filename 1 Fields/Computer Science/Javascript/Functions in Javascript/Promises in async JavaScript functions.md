A **promise** is an object that represents an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

| Definition               | A promise is a JavaScript object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| States                   | A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Methods                  | Promises have two main methods: then and catch. The then method is used to handle a promise's success and receives a callback function that takes the resolved value as its argument. The catch method is used to handle a promise's failure and receives a callback function that takes the rejected reason as its argument. |
| Chaining                 | Promises can be chained together using the then method. The return value of a then method is always a new promise, allowing multiple asynchronous operations to be chained together.                                                                                                                                          |
| Error handling           | Promises provide a cleaner and more consistent way to handle errors than traditional callback functions. Any errors that occur during the promise chain can be caught using the catch method.                                                                                                                                 |
| Parallelism              | Promises can be used to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel, and to wait for all of them to complete using the Promise.all method.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Library support          | Promises are supported by many JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including Node.js, Angular, and React.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Asynchronous programming | Promises are an important tool for asynchronous programming in JavaScript, allowing developers to write code that is more concise, readable, and maintainable.                                                                                                                                                                |
