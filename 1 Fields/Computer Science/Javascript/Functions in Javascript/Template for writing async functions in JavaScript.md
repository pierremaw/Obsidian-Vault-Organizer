| main() function             | main() is a common name for a JavaScript function that serves as the entry point for a script or application. It typically contains the core logic for the script and may call other functions or APIs as needed. The main() function is often asynchronous, meaning that it returns a Promise that resolves when the script has finished executing. |
| .then() method              | The .then() method is used to chain a Promise after another Promise. In this case, it's used to handle the Promise returned by the main() function. If the main() Promise resolves successfully, the .then() method will call process.exit(0), which exits the script with a status code of 0 (indicating success).                                  |
| process.exit(0)             | process.exit(0) is a Node.js method that exits the current process with a status code of 0. A status code of 0 typically indicates successful completion of a script or program.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| .catch() method             | The .catch() method is used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a Promise. If the main() Promise rejects with an error, the .catch() method will be called with the error object as its parameter.                                                                                                                                   |
| error parameter             | The error parameter is an object that contains information about an error that occurred during the execution of a script or program. It typically includes a message property that provides a brief description of the error, as well as other properties that provide additional context or details.                                                |
| console.error() function    | console.error() is a Node.js method that logs an error message to the console. It's commonly used to report errors that occur during the execution of a script or program.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| process.exit(1)             | process.exit(1) is a Node.js method that exits the current process with a status code of 1. A status code of 1 typically indicates an error or failure in a script or program.                                                                                                                                                                       |
