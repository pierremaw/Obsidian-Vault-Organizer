| Feature | Concept | Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Async keyword | Declares an async function that returns a promise¹² | Simplifies the code for performing asynchronous operations¹² |
| Await keyword | Pauses the execution of the async function until the awaited promise is fulfilled or rejected¹² | Improves the readability and maintainability of code that involves complex logic or error handling for asynchronous operations[^1]^ [^^2^^]^ |
| Promise return | Wraps the return value of an async function in a promise if it is not already a promise¹² | Enables asynchronous behavior with promises without explicitly configuring promise chains[^1]^ [^^2^^]^ |
| Async expression | Defines an async function as an expression that can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument¹² | Makes use of modern JavaScript features, such as destructuring assignment, template literals, and default parameters, to write concise and expressive code for asynchronous operations[^1]^ [^^2^^]^ |
| Async generator function | Combines the features of async functions and generator functions with both async and function* keywords³ | Handles asynchronous tasks ergonomically with await, while leveraging the lazy nature of generator functions[^3]^|
