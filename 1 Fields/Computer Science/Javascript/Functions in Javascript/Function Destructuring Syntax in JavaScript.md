| Function return values      | In JavaScript, functions can return values to the calling code. These values can be of any data type, including primitive types like strings and numbers, as well as objects and arrays.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Extracting return values    | To extract return values from a function in JavaScript, you can use the function call expression in conjunction with variable assignment. For example, let result = myFunction(arg1, arg2) calls the myFunction function with the specified arguments, and assigns the return value to the result variable.                                                                          |
| Multiple return values      | JavaScript functions can return multiple values by returning an array or an object with multiple properties. To extract multiple return values, you can use array destructuring or object destructuring syntax. For example, const [result1, result2] = myFunction() assigns the first and second elements of the array returned by myFunction to result1 and result2, respectively. |
| Error handling              | Functions in JavaScript can also throw errors to indicate that something has gone wrong. To handle errors, you can use a try...catch block around the function call expression. For example, try { let result = myFunction() } catch(error) { console.error(error) } calls the myFunction function and catches any errors that are thrown.                                           |
| Asynchronous functions      | Asynchronous functions in JavaScript, such as those that interact with web APIs or make network requests, typically return promises instead of values. To extract values from promises, you can use the then() method and/or the await keyword. For example, myAsyncFunction().then(result => console.log(result)) logs the result of the myAsyncFunction promise when it resolves.  |
| Promises                    | Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and allow you to handle the result of that operation when it is available. Promises have several methods, including then(), catch(), and finally(), that allow you to handle successful completion, errors, and cleanup tasks, respectively.                    |
