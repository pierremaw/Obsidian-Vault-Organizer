**before()**: A function that sets up the test context before tests are run.

| Feature/Concept/Application | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Hooks                       | The before() function is a type of hook that runs before all of the tests in a test suite. It is typically used to set up any necessary resources or fixtures that the tests will need.                                                  |
| Asynchronous                | The before() function can be declared as an asynchronous function by using the async keyword. This allows it to use asynchronous APIs, such as making HTTP requests or querying databases.                                               |
| Test fixtures               | The before() function is often used to set up test fixtures, which are a set of pre-defined inputs, outputs, and states that are used as the basis for tests. Test fixtures can help to ensure that tests are consistent and repeatable. |
| Scope                       | The variables and objects defined within the before() function have a scope that is limited to the test suite. This can help to prevent name collisions and make the test code more modular and reusable.                                |
