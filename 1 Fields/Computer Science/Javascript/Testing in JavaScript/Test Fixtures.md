A test fixture, also known as a text context, is the set of preconditions or state needed to run a test. The developer should set up a known good state before the tests and return to the original state after the tests.

| Setup and teardown          | Text fixtures are typically used to set up a known environment before running tests, and to tear that environment down after the tests are complete. This ensures that each test runs in a known, isolated environment.                                                           |
| Reusability                 | Text fixtures can be reused across multiple tests, allowing for code reuse and simplifying test maintenance.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Test data generation        | Text fixtures can be used to generate test data that is used by multiple tests. This can simplify test setup and make tests more consistent.                                                                                                                                      |
| Test isolation              | Text fixtures can help to isolate tests from each other, preventing side effects from one test from impacting other tests.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Test dependencies           | Text fixtures can be used to set up and manage dependencies between tests. For example, a database connection might be set up as a text fixture that is used by multiple tests.                                                                                                   |
| Asynchronous                | Text fixtures can be asynchronous, allowing them to perform asynchronous setup and teardown tasks, such as connecting to a database or making HTTP requests.                                                                                                                      |
| Framework-specific          | The implementation of text fixtures can vary depending on the testing framework being used. For example, in Jest, text fixtures are created using the beforeEach() and afterEach() functions, while in Mocha, text fixtures are created using the before() and after() functions. |
