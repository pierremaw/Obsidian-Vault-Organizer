| Test suite                  | The describe() function is used to define a test suite, which is a group of related tests that are organized together. This can help with code organization and make it easier to identify which tests are associated with which parts of the codebase. |
| Readability                 | By grouping related tests together under a common test suite, it can make the test code more readable and easier to understand. Developers can quickly identify the intent and purpose of a group of tests.                                             |
| Test hierarchy              | describe() functions can be nested to create a hierarchical structure of test suites. This can help with organizing more complex codebases and allows developers to test individual components or modules of a larger system.                           |
| Hooks                       | describe() functions can also be used to define hooks, which are functions that run before or after a test suite or individual test case. This can be used to set up or tear down test fixtures, or to perform other tasks that are needed for testing. |
| Usage                       | The describe function is used for grouping related specs1.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Syntax                      | The syntax to use describe is: describe(string, callback)1.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Origin                      | The describe / beforeEach / it convention originated with the Ruby testing library RSpec and is often referred to as spec-style2.                                                                                                                       |
| Benefits                    | Using a testing framework makes it easier to write and organize tests for front-end and back-end development3.                                                                                                                                          |
