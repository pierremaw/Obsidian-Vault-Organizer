| Test case definition        | it() is a function used to define a single test case within a test suite.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Function arguments          | it() takes two arguments: a string that describes the test case, and a function that contains the actual test code.                                                                                                                                            |
| Test description            | The first argument of it() is a string that describes the behavior being tested. This description should be clear and concise, making it easy to understand what is being tested.                                                                              |
| Asynchronous testing        | it() can include asynchronous code, as is the case with the async keyword in the example provided. This allows for testing of asynchronous functions and promises.                                                                                             |
| Assertion library           | it() is typically used in conjunction with an assertion library such as Chai or Jest to provide a way to compare expected values with actual values produced by the code being tested.                                                                         |
| Test results                | The test function within it() should produce a clear result indicating whether the test has passed or failed. This result is typically produced using an assertion within the test function.                                                                   |
| Test reporting              | Testing frameworks often provide detailed test reports that display the results of each test case, including whether it passed or failed and any relevant error messages. These reports help developers quickly identify any issues that need to be addressed. |
