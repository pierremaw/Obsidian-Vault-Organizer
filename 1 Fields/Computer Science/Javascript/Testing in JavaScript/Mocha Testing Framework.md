| Test Runner            | Mocha is a test runner that provides a clear and flexible structure for organizing tests.                                          |
| Assertion              | Mocha provides an assertion library, such as Chai, to provide a way to compare values to the expected output.                      |
| Hooks                  | Mocha provides hooks to allow for pre-test setup and post-test teardown, such as before(), after(), beforeEach(), and afterEach(). |
| Asynchronous           | Mocha allows asynchronous testing using done() or returning a Promise.                                                             |
| Parallelization        | Mocha allows parallel execution of tests with multiple cores or even multiple machines.                                            |
| Reporters              | Mocha provides various reporters to generate test reports in different formats.                                                    |
| Browser Support        | Mocha can run tests in the browser using browser-specific libraries, such as Karma or Testem.                                      |
| Continuous Integration | Mocha is compatible with various CI tools, such as Travis CI, Jenkins, and CircleCI.                                               |
| Integration Testing    | Mocha is commonly used for integration testing to test the interactions between different components of a system.                  |
| Unit Testing           | Mocha is also used for unit testing to test individual functions or small code components.                                         |
