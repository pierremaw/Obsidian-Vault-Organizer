| Extensibility                             | JSON can be extended to include custom data types and structures using the JSON Schema standard                                                    |
| Interoperability                          | JSON is widely supported across programming languages and platforms, and is used for data exchange between web services and applications           |
| Serialization                             | The process of converting a data structure or object into a JSON string                                                                            |
