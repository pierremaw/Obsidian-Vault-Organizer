| Object literal syntax             | Objects can be created using a simple syntax of curly braces containing key-value pairs separated by colons, e.g. { name: "John", age: 25 }                                                                                          |
| Object-oriented programming       | JavaScript is an object-oriented language, with objects playing a central role in the language's programming paradigm. Objects can have properties and methods, making them powerful tools for encapsulating functionality and data. |
| Prototypes                        | JavaScript uses a prototype-based object model, where each object can have a prototype object, which it inherits properties and methods from. This allows for efficient memory usage and code reuse.                                 |
| Property accessors                | Object properties can be accessed using either dot notation (e.g. obj.name) or bracket notation (e.g. obj['name']). Bracket notation allows for dynamic property names.                                                              |
| Object methods                    | Objects can have methods, which are simply functions that are defined as properties of the object. This allows for encapsulation of functionality and can make code more readable and maintainable.                                  |
| Object iteration                  | Objects can be iterated over using loops or higher-order functions like Object.keys() and Object.values().                                                                                                                           |
| JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) | JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is based on the syntax of JavaScript objects. It is widely used for data exchange between systems and languages.                                                                  |
