| Promise-based HTTP client   | axios.post is a function provided by the axios package that allows you to make HTTP requests to external APIs.                                                                      |
| Send POST requests          | With axios.post, you can send HTTP POST requests to a specified URL, with optional data to include in the request body.                                                             |
| Asynchronous execution      | axios.post returns a Promise that resolves with the response data from the API once the request is complete. This allows for non-blocking, asynchronous execution of HTTP requests. |
| Configurable options        | axios.post accepts an options object as its second parameter, allowing you to configure various aspects of the request, such as headers, request data, and response handling.       |
