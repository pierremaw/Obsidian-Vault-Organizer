| if/else statements   | Allows for conditional branching in code based on a given condition. If the condition is true, the code within the if block is executed, otherwise, the code within the else block is executed.                                                                                  |
| switch statements    | Similar to if/else statements, switch statements provide multiple branches for conditional execution based on a given value. The value is compared to each case within the switch block, and the corresponding code is executed.                                                 |
| for loops            | Used for iterating over a set of data a specific number of times. The loop executes as long as the condition specified in the for statement is true.                                                                                                                             |
| while loops          | Used for iterating over a set of data until a certain condition is met. The loop executes as long as the condition specified in the while statement is true.                                                                                                                     |
| do/while loops       | Similar to while loops, except that the code block is executed first before checking the condition. This ensures that the code block is executed at least once.                                                                                                                  |
| break statement      | Used to terminate a loop or switch statement prematurely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| continue statement   | Used to skip a specific iteration within a loop and continue to the next iteration.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ternary operator     | A shorthand notation for an if/else statement that allows for conditional execution of code within a single line of code. The syntax is as follows: condition ? expression1 : expression2. If the condition is true, expression1 is executed, otherwise expression2 is executed. |
| try/catch blocks     | Used for handling errors in code. The try block contains the code that may throw an error, and the catch block contains the code that is executed if an error is thrown.                                                                                                         |
| throw statement      | Used to manually throw an error within code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
