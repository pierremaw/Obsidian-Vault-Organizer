| Primitive Data Types | Primitive data types are the basic building blocks of data in JavaScript. There are six primitive data types: undefined, null, boolean, number, string, and symbol.                                                          |
| boolean              | The boolean data type represents a logical value of either true or false.                                                                                                                                                    |
| number               | The number data type represents a numeric value, including integers and floating-point numbers.                                                                                                                              |
| string               | The string data type represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.                                                                                                                               |
| null                 | The null data type represents a deliberate non-value or absence of an object.                                                                                                                                                |
| undefined            | The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.                                                                                                                               |
| symbol               | The symbol data type represents a unique identifier, used as property keys in objects.                                                                                                                                       |
| Type Coercion        | JavaScript performs type coercion automatically when values of different types are used together in an operation. For example, the + operator can be used for concatenating strings or adding numbers.                       |
| Type Conversion      | Explicit type conversion can be performed using methods like Number(), String(), and Boolean().                                                                                                                              |
| Immutability         | Primitive values are immutable, which means that their values cannot be changed once they are assigned. Any operation on a primitive value returns a new value, rather than modifying the original value.                    |
| Pass-by-Value        | In JavaScript, primitive values are passed by value, which means that a copy of the value is passed to a function or assigned to a new variable. This is in contrast to reference data types, which are passed by reference. |
