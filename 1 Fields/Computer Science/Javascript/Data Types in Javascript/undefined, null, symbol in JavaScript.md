| Feature | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| undefined data type         | The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.                                              |
| null data type              | The null data type represents a deliberate non-value, typically used to indicate that a variable has no value or that an object does not exist.      |
| symbol data type            | The symbol data type represents a unique identifier that can be used as an object property key.                                                      |
| Default values              | If a variable is not assigned a value, its default value is undefined.                                                                               |
| Checking for undefined      | The typeof operator can be used to check if a variable is undefined.                                                                                 |
| Checking for null           | The null value is falsy, meaning it evaluates to false in a boolean context, and can be checked using the == equality operator.                      |
| Creating symbols            | Symbols can be created using the Symbol() function, and can be used as unique property keys to prevent naming conflicts in object properties.        |
| Global symbols              | Symbols can be shared globally using the Symbol.for() method, which creates a symbol in a global registry and returns it.                            |
| Primitive data types        | undefined, null, and symbol are all primitive data types in JavaScript.                                                                              |
| Immutability                | undefined, null, and symbol are all immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created.                                         |
| Garbage collection          | null is used to indicate that an object is no longer needed and can be garbage collected by the JavaScript runtime.                                  |
| Security                    | Symbols can be used to create private object properties that cannot be accessed from outside the object, improving security in JavaScript programs.  |
| ECMAScript 6                | symbol was introduced in ECMAScript 6 as a new primitive data type.                                                                                  |
| Browser support             | null and undefined have been supported in all major browsers since early versions of JavaScript, while symbol has limited support in older browsers. |
| Node.js support             | null, undefined, and symbol are all supported in Node.js, and can be used in server-side JavaScript programming.                                     |
