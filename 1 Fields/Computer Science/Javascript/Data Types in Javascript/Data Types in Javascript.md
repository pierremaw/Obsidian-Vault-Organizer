| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Primitive data types   | JavaScript has six primitive data types: boolean, number, string, undefined, null, and symbol.                                                                                           |
| Object data type       | In addition to primitive data types, JavaScript has an object data type that represents complex data structures.                                                                         |
| Type coercion          | JavaScript automatically converts data types when they are used in a context that requires a different type.                                                                             |
| Type checking          | The typeof operator can be used to check the data type of a value or variable.                                                                                                           |
| Type conversion        | The parseInt, parseFloat, and toString functions can be used to convert between data types.                                                                                              |
| Array data type        | JavaScript has an array data type that can be used to store collections of values.                                                                                                       |
| Object data type       | Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs, and can be used to represent complex data structures.                                                                          |
| JSON                   | JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write, and can be used to represent complex data structures.                         |
| Date data type         | JavaScript has a built-in Date object that can be used to represent and manipulate dates and times.                                                                                      |
| OOP                    | Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on using objects to represent real-world entities, and is supported in JavaScript through its object data type. |
| Prototypal inheritance | JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance to create object hierarchies and inherit behavior from parent objects.                                                                            |
