| Keywords                    | Keywords in JavaScript are reserved words that have special meaning in the language and cannot be used as variable names, function names, or other identifiers.                                |
| Variable Declarations       | let, const, and var are keywords used for declaring variables in JavaScript. let and const were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6), while var has been part of the language since the beginning. |
| Control Flow                | if, else, switch, and case are keywords used for controlling the flow of execution in JavaScript. They are used to perform conditional and iterative operations.                               |
| Loops                       | for, while, and do...while are keywords used for looping and iteration in JavaScript.                                                                                                          |
| Functions                   | function is a keyword used for defining functions in JavaScript. Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called multiple times with different inputs.                                |
| Classes                     | class is a keyword introduced in ES6 for defining classes in JavaScript. Classes are a way of creating objects with similar properties and methods.                                            |
| Asynchronous Operations     | async and await are keywords introduced in ES8 for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They make it easier to write and read asynchronous code that relies on Promises.            |
| Strict Mode                 | use strict is a directive that enables strict mode in JavaScript, which enforces stricter syntax and rules.                                                                                    |
| Module Imports/Exports      | import and export are keywords used for importing and exporting modules in JavaScript. Modules are a way of breaking up code into smaller, reusable components.                                |
