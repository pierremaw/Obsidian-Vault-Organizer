| Declaration                 | const variables are declared using the const keyword.                                                                                            | let variables are declared using the let keyword.                                                                                                | var variables are declared using the var keyword.                                                                                                              |
| Reassignment                | const variables cannot be reassigned after they are initialized.                                                                                 | let variables can be reassigned to a new value after they are initialized.                                                                       | var variables can be reassigned to a new value after they are initialized.                                                                                     |
| Initialization              | const variables must be initialized with a value when they are declared.                                                                         | let variables can be initialized with a value when they are declared, or they can be assigned a value later in the code.                         | var variables can be initialized with a value when they are declared, or they can be assigned a value later in the code.                                       |
| Scope                       | const and let variables are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined, or any nested blocks. | const and let variables are block-scoped, which means they are only accessible within the block in which they are defined, or any nested blocks. | var variables are function-scoped, which means they are accessible within the function in which they are defined, or any nested functions.                     |
| Hoisting                    | const and let variables are not hoisted to the top of their respective scopes, so you cannot use them before they are declared.                  | const and let variables are not hoisted to the top of their respective scopes, so you cannot use them before they are declared.                  | var variables are hoisted to the top of their respective scopes, so you can use them before they are declared, but they will be assigned a value of undefined. |
| Examples                    | const PI = 3.14159;                                                                                                                              | let x = 5; x = 10;                                                                                                                               | var count = 0; for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) { count += i; }                                                                                                    |
