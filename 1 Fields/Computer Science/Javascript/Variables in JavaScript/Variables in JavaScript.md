Here is a table that contains detailed text information about variables in JavaScript:

| Feature            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value              | The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Memory             | A variable is only a name given to a memory location. All operations done on the variable affect that memory location.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Declaration        | In JavaScript, all variables must be declared before they can be usedÂ¹. Variables can be declared using `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Naming             | All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.                                                                                             |
| Scope              | The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed within a program. const and let variables are block-scoped, which means they can only be accessed within the block in which they are defined or any nested blocks. var variables are function-scoped, which means they can be accessed within the function in which they are defined or any nested functions. |
| Hoisting           | JavaScript variables are hoisted, which means that they are moved to the top of their respective scopes before the code is executed. This means that you can use a variable before it is declared, but it will be assigned a value of undefined.                                                                                                                          |
| Initialization     | Variables in JavaScript can be initialized with a value when they are declared, or they can be assigned a value later in the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Constants          | Constants are variables that cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. They are declared using the const keyword.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mutable Variables  | Mutable variables are variables whose values can be changed after they are initialized. They are declared using the let or var keyword.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Global Variables   | Global variables are variables that are accessible from anywhere in the code. They are declared outside of any functions or blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Local Variables    | Local variables are variables that are accessible only within the function or block in which they are defined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Type Coercion      | JavaScript is a loosely-typed language, which means that variables can change type dynamically. Type coercion is the process of converting a value from one type to another.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Garbage Collection | JavaScript automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used by variables. This is known as garbage collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
