JavaScript has two types of scope: block scope and function scope. In this guide, we will explain what block scope and function scope are, and how they differ from each other.

# Block Scope

Block scope refers to the scope of a variable that is defined inside a block of code (i.e., between curly braces). A block can be a function, a loop, a conditional statement, or any other block of code that is enclosed in curly braces. Here's an example:

```
function foo() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 1; // x is defined in the block scope of the if statement
  }
  console.log(x); // logs 1
}
```

In this example, we define a function `foo` that contains an if statement. Inside the if statement, we define a variable `x` with the value `1`. The variable `x` is defined in the block scope of the if statement, and is not accessible outside the if statement. However, because we use the `var` keyword to define `x`, it is accessible inside the function `foo`, and we can log its value to the console.

# Function Scope

Function scope refers to the scope of a variable that is defined inside a function. A variable that is defined inside a function is only accessible inside that function (unless it is explicitly returned or passed to another function). Here's an example:

```
function foo() {
  var x = 1; // x is defined in the function scope of foo
  console.log(x); // logs 1
}

console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined

```

In this example, we define a function `foo` that contains a variable `x` with the value `1`. The variable `x` is defined in the function scope of `foo`, and is not accessible outside the function. When we try to log `x` to the console outside the function, we get a reference error.

## Conclusion

In summary, JavaScript has two types of scope: block scope and function scope. Block scope refers to the scope of a variable that is defined inside a block of code, and function scope refers to the scope of a variable that is defined inside a function. Understanding these two types of scope is essential for writing clear and maintainable code in JavaScript.
