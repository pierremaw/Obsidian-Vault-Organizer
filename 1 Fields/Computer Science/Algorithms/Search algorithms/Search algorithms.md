**Search algorithms** are used to search for an item in a data structure. One example is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a list. Types of search algorithms include linear search and binary search.

**[[Linear search]]**
	- A simple search algorithm for finding an item in an unordered or ordered list. It works by iterating through the list sequentially and comparing each item to the target item until it is found.

**Binary search**
	- An efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and narrowing down the possible positions of the item until it is found.
