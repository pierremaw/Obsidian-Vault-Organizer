- **Two Pointers**: An algorithmic technique that uses two pointers to traverse and manipulate data structures like arrays and linked lists efficiently.
    - **Initialization**: Setting up initial positions for the two pointers.
    - **Movement**: Updating the positions of the pointers based on certain conditions.
    - **Use cases**: Array manipulation, subarray problems, linked list operations.
    
- **Sliding Window**: A technique for efficiently processing subarrays or subsequences in a data structure by maintaining a "window" of elements.
    - **Fixed-size window**: A window with a constant size that slides over the data structure.
    - **Variable-size window**: A window with a flexible size that adapts to specific conditions.
    - **Use cases**: Maximum/minimum subarray problems, substring problems, longest consecutive sequence problems.
      
- **Binary Search**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm for searching sorted data structures by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
    - **Iterative**: An implementation that uses a loop to reduce the search interval.
    - **Recursive**: An implementation that uses recursion to reduce the search interval.
    - **Use cases**: Searching in sorted arrays or lists, finding the square root of a number, searching for a specific value in a sorted matrix.
      
- **Matrix**: Algorithms that work with two-dimensional data structures, also known as matrices or grids.
    - **Traversal**: Strategies for visiting matrix elements, such as row-by-row, column-by-column, or spiral order.
    - **Transformation**: Rotating, flipping, or modifying matrix elements.
    - **Use cases**: Image processing, game boards, shortest path problems in grids.

- **Stack**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that stores and retrieves elements using two main operations: push and pop.    
    - **Usage**: Implementing backtracking, parsing expressions, or maintaining state.
    - **Implementations**: Arrays, linked lists, or dynamic arrays.
    - **Use cases**: Parentheses matching, histogram problems, depth-first search.
      
- **Priority Queues/Heap**: Data structures that maintain elements in a sorted order based on their priority.
    - **Heap**: A binary tree-based data structure that efficiently implements a priority queue.
    - **Operations**: Insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements with the highest or lowest priority.
    - **Use cases**: Scheduling tasks, finding the kth largest or smallest element, Dijkstra's algorithm.

- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    - **Implementation**: Recursive or iterative using a stack.
    - **Applications**: Detecting cycles, topological sorting, solving mazes.
    - **Use cases**: Graph traversal, tree traversal, pathfinding.
      
- **Dynamic Programming**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and storing the results.
    - **Top-down**: Starting from the original problem and recursively solving smaller subproblems.
    - **Bottom-up**: Iteratively solving subproblems and building up to the original problem.
    - **Use cases**: Optimal solutions for combinatorial problems, longest common subsequence, shortest path problems.

- **Recursion**: A technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem, usually implemented as a function that calls itself.    
    - **Base case**: The simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly.
    - **Recursive step**: Reducing the problem to a smaller instance that can be solved recursively.
    - **Use cases**: Tree and graph traversal, backtracking, divide-and-conquer algorithms.

- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: A graph traversal algorithm that visits all the vertices of a graph at the same "level" before moving on to the next level.
	- **Implementation**: Iterative using a queue.
	- **Applications**: Shortest path, connected components, bipartite graph checking.
	-   **Use cases**: Graph traversal, tree traversal, pathfinding in unweighted graphs.
