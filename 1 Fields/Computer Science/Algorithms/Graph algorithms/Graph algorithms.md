Breadth-first search (BFS): used for finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.

Depth-first search (DFS): used for traversing a graph and finding all connected components.

Dijkstra's algorithm: used for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

Bellman-Ford algorithm: similar to Dijkstra's algorithm but can also handle negative edge weights.

A* algorithm: an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses an additional heuristic function to guide the search.

Kruskal's algorithm: used for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph (a tree that includes all nodes in the graph with the minimum total edge weight).

Prim's algorithm: similar to Kruskal's algorithm but starts with a single node and grows the tree one node at a time.

Topological sorting: used for ordering the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v.

Strongly connected component (SCC): used for finding all strongly connected components in a directed graph.

Detecting cycle: used for finding if there is any cycle in a directed or undirected graph
