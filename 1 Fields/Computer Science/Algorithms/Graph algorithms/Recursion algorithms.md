**Recursion**: A technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

-   **Base Case**: The stopping point for recursive calls.
-   **Recursive Case**: Function calls itself with modified inputs.
-   **Call Stack**: Tracks function calls and local variables.
-   **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks problem into smaller subproblems.
-   **Overlapping Subproblems**: Repeatedly solved subproblems.
-   **Tail Recursion**: Recursive call is the last operation in function.

### Steps to Implement Recursion

1. **Base Case:** Identify the simplest situation that can be solved explicity. This is the stopping point for the recursive calls.
2.  **Recursive Case:** Define the problem using smaller subproblems. Call the function recursively with these smaller inputs.

The base case is the condition that stops recursive function calls. If the function input triggers the base case, the function stops calling itself and returns a value.

If the input does not trigger the base case, the function calls itself with modified inputs. This is called the recursive case.
