* **Special Relativity**: Describes physical laws for objects moving at constant speeds
    * **Inertial Frames**: Non-accelerating reference frames, identical laws of physics
    * **Lorentz Transformation**: Equations relating space and time coordinates
    * **Time Dilation**: Time slows for objects nearing light-speed
    * **Length Contraction**: Objects contract in motion direction when approaching light-speed
    * **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Interchangeable energy and mass, represented by E=mcÂ²
    * **Simultaneity**: Events occurring at the same time can vary between observers
