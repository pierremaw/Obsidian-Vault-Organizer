* **Special Relativity**: Focuses on objects moving at constant speeds, including near light-speed
    * **Inertial Frames**: Non-accelerating reference frames, laws of physics are identical
    * **Lorentz Transformation**: Equations relating space and time coordinates between inertial frames
    * **Time Dilation**: Time slows down for objects moving near the speed of light
    * **Length Contraction**: Objects contract in the direction of motion when approaching light-speed
    * **Mass-Energy Equivalence**: Energy and mass are interchangeable, represented by E=mcÂ²

* **General Relativity**: Gravitation as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass-energy
    * **Spacetime**: Four-dimensional continuum, combining three dimensions of space and time
    * **Curvature**: Distortion of spacetime by massive objects, influencing the motion of objects
    * **Geodesics**: Shortest paths followed by objects in curved spacetime, determined by mass distribution
    * **Gravitational Waves**: Ripples in spacetime produced by accelerating massive objects
    * **Black Holes**: Massive objects with gravitational pull so strong that light cannot escape

* **Experimental Evidence**: Observations and tests confirming the Theory of Relativity
    * **Michelson-Morley Experiment**: Failed to detect Earth's motion through aether, supporting Special Relativity
    * **Gravitational Lensing**: Light bending around massive objects, predicted by General Relativity
    * **GPS Corrections**: Satellite time adjustments accounting for relativistic effects on timekeeping
    * **LIGO**: Detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes, validating General Relativity
