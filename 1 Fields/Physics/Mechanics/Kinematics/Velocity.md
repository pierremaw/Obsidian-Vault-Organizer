Velocity is the directional speed of an object in motion as an indication of its rate of change in position as observed from a particular frame of reference and as measured by a particular standard of time (e.g. 60 km/h northbound).

# Speed vs Velocity

Speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving. It only considers the magnitude of an object's movement and is expressed in units such as meters per second (m/s).

Velocity, on the other hand, is a vector quantity that includes both the magnitude and direction of an object's movement. It is expressed in units such as meters per second (m/s) in a specific direction. For example, if an object is moving with a speed of 10 m/s to the east, its velocity would be represented as 10 m/s east.

**velocity is the first derivative, and acceleration is the second derivative**. So, if we have a position function s (t), the first derivative is velocity, v (t), and the second is acceleration, a (t).
