Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that deals with the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. It is concerned with describing the motion of an object, rather than the causes of the motion. This guide will provide a step-by-step explanation of the basic concepts of kinematics and how to use them to analyze the motion of objects.

# Key Terms

Before diving into the details, let's define some key terms that are frequently used in kinematics.

-   Displacement: The change in position of an object.
-   Velocity: The rate of change of displacement with respect to time.
-   Acceleration: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time.
