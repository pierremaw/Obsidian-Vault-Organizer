- **Logic**: The systematic study of valid reasoning, inference, and argumentation in philosophical context.

## **Types of Logic**
- **Deductive Logic**: Reasoning from general principles to specific conclusions.
- **Inductive Logic**: Reasoning from specific observations to general principles.

## **Deductive Logic**
- **Syllogisms**: Arguments with two premises and a conclusion.
    - Example:
        1. All humans are mortal (major premise)
        2. Socrates is a human (minor premise)
        3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion)
- **Propositional Logic**: The study of logical relationships between propositions.
    - Example: 
        - If it rains (P), then the ground will be wet (Q).
        - It is raining (P).
        - Therefore, the ground is wet (Q).
- **Modal Logic**: The study of the modes of truth, such as necessity and possibility.
    - Example: 
        - Necessarily, if Socrates is human, Socrates is mortal.
        - Socrates is human.
        - Therefore, Socrates is necessarily mortal.

## **Inductive Logic**
- **Generalizations**: Drawing general conclusions based on specific instances.
    - Example:
        - Every swan observed so far is white.
        - Therefore, all swans are white.
- **Predictions**: Forecasting future events based on past observations.
    - Example:
        - The sun has risen every day in recorded history.
        - Therefore, the sun will rise tomorrow.

## **Logical Fallacies**
- **Definition**: Errors in reasoning that weaken an argument or render it invalid.
- **Examples**:
    - **Ad hominem**: Attacking the person rather than addressing the argument.
    - **Straw man**: Misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to refute.
    - **False cause**: Mistaking correlation for causation.
