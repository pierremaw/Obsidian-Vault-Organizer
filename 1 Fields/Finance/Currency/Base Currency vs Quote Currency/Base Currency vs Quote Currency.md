| Definition  | In a currency pair, the base currency is the first currency listed, and the quote currency is the second currency listed. The value of the currency pair is determined by the exchange rate between the two currencies.                                                         |
| Role        | The base currency is the currency being bought or sold, while the quote currency is the currency used to make the transaction. For example, in the EUR/USD currency pair, the euro is the base currency and the US dollar is the quote currency.                                |
| Pricing     | The exchange rate of a currency pair expresses the value of the base currency in terms of the quote currency. For example, an exchange rate of 1.20 for the EUR/USD pair means that one euro is worth 1.20 US dollars.                                                          |
| Liquidity   | The liquidity of a currency pair depends on the popularity of the base and quote currencies, as well as the volume of trading activity for the pair. Highly liquid currency pairs have tighter bid-ask spreads and are easier to buy and sell.                                  |
| Correlation | Currency pairs can be correlated, meaning that their prices move in the same direction. This can be used to hedge positions or to identify trading opportunities.                                                                                                               |
| Cross rates | A cross rate is a currency pair that does not include the US dollar. Cross rates are calculated by using two other currency pairs that both include the US dollar. For example, the EUR/JPY cross rate can be calculated by multiplying the EUR/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates. |
