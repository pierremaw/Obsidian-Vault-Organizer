- **Overview**: The process of teaching LLMs to understand and generate human-like text using massive datasets.

- **Data preparation**: Collecting, cleaning, and organizing data for training purposes.
  - **Text corpus**: A large collection of text data, often from diverse sources, used for training.
  - **Data cleaning**: Removing noise, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information from the text corpus.
  - **Data preprocessing**: Transforming the text data into a format suitable for model training, such as tokenization.

- **Model architecture selection**: Choosing the most suitable model structure for the specific LLM.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Sequence-based models that can handle temporal dependencies.
  - **Transformers**: Attention-based models that enable parallel processing and improved handling of long-range dependencies.

- **Training techniques**: Strategies and methods for effectively teaching LLMs.
  - **Supervised learning**: Training using labeled datasets where the input/output pairs are provided.
  - **Unsupervised learning**: Training using unlabeled datasets, allowing the model to discover patterns and relationships.
  - **Transfer learning**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a specific task or domain.

- **Optimization**: Fine-tuning model parameters to minimize the loss function and improve performance.
  - **Gradient descent**: An iterative optimization algorithm used to update model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function.
  - **Learning rate**: A hyperparameter that controls the step size of gradient descent updates.
  - **Regularization**: Techniques for preventing overfitting, such as weight decay and dropout.

- **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance of LLMs during and after training.
  - **Training loss**: The value of the loss function for the training data, which should decrease as training progresses.
  - **Validation loss**: The value of the loss function for a held-out validation dataset, used to monitor for overfitting and tune hyperparameters.
  - **Early stopping**: A technique for ending training when the validation loss stops improving, preventing overfitting.

- **Model deployment**: Making the trained LLM available for use in real-world applications.
  - **Inference**: Using the trained model to generate predictions or outputs for new input data.
  - **Model serving**: Hosting the model on a server or cloud platform to provide access to users or other systems.
  - **Continuous improvement**: Monitoring model performance, collecting feedback, and updating the model as needed.
