- **Large language model**: an artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate language data like written text or programming code.

- **Training**: The process of teaching a large language model using a massive dataset of text.
  - **Supervised learning**: Learning from labeled datasets where the input/output pairs are provided.
  - **Unsupervised learning**: Learning from unlabeled datasets where the model discovers patterns and relationships.
  - **Transfer learning**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a specific task or domain.

- **Architecture**: The underlying structure of large language models.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Sequence-based models where neurons have loops, allowing for the persistence of information across time steps.
  - **Transformers**: Attention-based models that enable parallel processing and improved handling of long-range dependencies.
    - **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: A series of large-scale transformer-based models, including GPT-3 and GPT-4.
    - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: A transformer-based model that learns bidirectional context and improves performance on a variety of NLP tasks.

- **Tokenization**: The process of converting text into tokens, or units of meaning, that can be processed by the model.
  - **Subword tokenization**: Breaking words into smaller units to better handle rare words and improve generalization.

- **Applications**: Tasks and use cases where large language models are employed.
  - **Text generation**: Producing coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input.
  - **Sentiment analysis**: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.
  - **Question answering**: Providing relevant and accurate answers to questions posed in natural language.
  - **Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of longer pieces of text.
  - **Translation**: Converting text from one language to another while preserving meaning.

- **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance and effectiveness of large language models.
  - **Perplexity**: A measure of uncertainty in predicting the next token, with lower values indicating better performance.
  - **F1 score**: A metric that combines precision and recall, useful for tasks such as question answering.
  - **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score**: A metric for evaluating machine translations, based on the similarity between the translation and a reference translation.

- **Challenges and limitations**: Issues that arise when working with large language models.
  - **Computational resources**: The extensive processing power and memory required to train and run large models.
  - **Data bias**: The presence of biases in the training data that can be propagated through the model.
  - **Ethical considerations**: The potential for harmful applications or the amplification of existing biases in society.
