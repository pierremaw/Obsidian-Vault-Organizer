AI is digital intelligence.

# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- **AI**: digital intelligence that can mimic intelligent human behaviour. For instance, tasks such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.

___

- **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI focused on creating algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time.
  - **Supervised learning**: Training algorithms using labeled data, where input-output pairs are provided.
  - **Unsupervised learning**: Training algorithms using unlabeled data, allowing the model to discover patterns and relationships.
  - **Reinforcement learning**: Training algorithms based on feedback done using rewards or penalties, based on their actions in an environment.

- **Deep Learning**: A subset of machine learning that focuses on multi-layered artificial neural networks, which enable AI models to learn complex representations and patterns.
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Networks designed for image processing and recognition tasks.
  - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Networks capable of handling temporal dependencies, suitable for sequence-based tasks such as natural language processing.
  - **Transformer models**: Attention-based models that enable parallel processing and improved handling of long-range dependencies.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: A branch of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language, enabling understanding, interpretation, and generation of human language.
  - **Sentiment analysis**: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text.
  - **Machine translation**: Automatically translating text from one language to another.
  - **Text summarization**: Generating a concise summary of a larger text document.

- **Computer Vision**: The area of AI that enables computers to understand and interpret visual information from the world, such as images or videos.
  - **Image classification**: Assigning predefined categories to images based on their content.
  - **Object detection**: Identifying and localizing objects within an image or video.
  - **Semantic segmentation**: Partitioning an image into semantically meaningful regions, associating each pixel with a specific category.

- **Robotics**: The intersection of AI and mechanical engineering, focused on the design, construction, and operation of robots capable of performing tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
  - **Path planning**: Determining the optimal route or sequence of actions for a robot to reach a goal.
  - **Manipulation**: Enabling robots to interact with objects in their environment, such as grasping or moving objects.
  - **Human-robot interaction**: Developing interfaces and algorithms that allow robots to effectively collaborate with humans.
