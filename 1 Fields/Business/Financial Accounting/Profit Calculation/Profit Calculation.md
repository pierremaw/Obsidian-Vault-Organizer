### Gross Profit
```text
Gross profit = Total revenue - COGS
```

For example, if a business sells 100 units of a product at $10 each, its total revenue is $1,000. If the cost of producing each unit is $6, its COGS is $600. Therefore, its gross profit is:
```text
Gross profit = $1,000 - $600
Gross profit = $400
```

### Net Profit
```text
Net profit = Gross profit - Total expenses
```

For example, if a business has a gross profit of $400 and its total expenses are $300, its net profit is:
```text
Net profit = $400 - $300
Net profit = $100
```
