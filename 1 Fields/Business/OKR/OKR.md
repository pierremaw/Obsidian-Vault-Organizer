An OKR is a metrics-based methodology for tracking your company initiatives. And it’s actually pretty simple!

- **Write down your goal**: That’s your objective, and it can be designed for a small team or even at the company level.
- **Set a time frame (usually 30-90 days)**: This ensures your goals are timebound, which is essential.
- **Assign three to five measurable objectives**: These are your key results, and they ladder up into your broader objectives. Similar to KPIs, these should be tangible and measurable.
