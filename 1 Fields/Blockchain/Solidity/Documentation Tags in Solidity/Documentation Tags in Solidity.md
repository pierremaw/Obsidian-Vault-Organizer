Solidity documentation tags are used to generate human-readable documentation for the contract's functions and variables. In this guide, we will go over the different documentation tags available in Solidity and how to use them.

## `@notice`

The `@notice` tag is used to provide a brief description of what the function does, typically in one sentence. This tag is optional, but it is considered a best practice to include it for all public functions in a Solidity contract. Here is an example of how to use the `@notice` tag:

```
/**
 * @notice Returns the balance of the specified address.
 * @param account The address to get the balance of.
 * @return The balance of the specified address.
 */
function getBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
    return balances[account];
}

```
## `@dev`

The `@dev` tag is used to provide additional information about the function that is only relevant for developers. This tag is also optional, but it can be useful for providing information about the inner workings of the function or for providing information about potential issues or edge cases. Here is an example of how to use the `@dev` tag:

```
/**
 * @notice Transfers tokens from one address to another.
 * @dev This function is not guaranteed to succeed if the sender does not have
 *      sufficient allowance or balance.
 * @param from The address to transfer tokens from.
 * @param to The address to transfer tokens to.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens to transfer.
 */
function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[from] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    require(allowances[from][msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");
    balances[from] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
    emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
}

```

## `@param`

The `@param` tag is used to provide information about the function's parameters. This tag should be used for each parameter in the function and should provide a description of what the parameter represents. Here is an example of how to use the `@param` tag:

solidityCopy code

`/**  * @notice Transfers tokens from one address to another.  * @param from The address to transfer tokens from.  * @param to The address to transfer tokens to.  * @param amount The amount of tokens to transfer.  */ function transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public {     // function logic here }`

## `@return`

The `@return` tag is used to provide information about the function's return value. This tag should be used for functions that return a value, and should provide a description of what the return value represents. Here is an example of how to use the `@return` tag:

solidityCopy code

`/**  * @notice Returns the balance of the specified address.  * @param account The address to get the balance of.  * @return The balance of the specified address.  */ function getBalance(address account) public view returns (uint256) {     return balances[account]; }`
