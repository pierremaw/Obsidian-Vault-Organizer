In Solidity, there are four important comment tags that are used to provide additional information about a function or contract, as follows:

1.  `@notice`: This tag is used to provide high-level information about a function or contract. It is used to describe what the function does, and is visible when a user views the function in a Solidity compiler or development environment.
    
2.  `@dev`: This tag is used to provide developer-level information about a function or contract. It is used to describe implementation details or provide additional information that would be useful for developers, but is not necessary for users to know. The `@dev` tag is also visible when a user views the function in a Solidity compiler or development environment.
    
3.  `@param`: This tag is used to provide information about the parameters of a function. It is used to describe the name, type, and purpose of each parameter. It is also visible when a user views the function in a Solidity compiler or development environment.
    
4.  `@return`: This tag is used to provide information about the return values of a function. It is used to describe the name, type, and purpose of each return value. It is also visible when a user views the function in a Solidity compiler or development environment.
    

Here is an example of how these comment tags can be used in Solidity:

```
contract ExampleContract {
    /**
     * @notice This function does something really important.
     * @dev It uses the latest and greatest algorithms to perform its task.
     * @param _input An integer that represents the input to the function.
     * @return An integer that represents the output of the function.
     */
    function exampleFunction(uint256 _input) public returns (uint256) {
        // implementation
    }
}

```

In this example, the `@notice` tag provides a high-level description of the function, the `@dev` tag provides additional implementation details, the `@param` tag describes the input parameter of the function, and the `@return` tag describes the output of the function.
