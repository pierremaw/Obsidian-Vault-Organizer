# If Statements

The `if` statement is a basic control structure in Solidity (as well as many other programming languages) that allows you to conditionally execute code based on a boolean expression. Here's the basic syntax for an `if` statement:

```
if (condition) {
	// code to execute if condition is true 
}
```

If the `condition` is true, then the code within the curly braces will be executed. Otherwise, it will be skipped over.
