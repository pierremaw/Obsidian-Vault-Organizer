A solidity contract is code that represents a computer program that can function on a blockchain.

| Feature    | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contracts                      | Solidity code that represents instructions for the way a smart contract should run on a blockchain network             |
| State variables                | Variables that store data that persists across function calls                                                                                                          |
| Functions                      | The main building blocks of a contract, which define the contract's behavior                                                                                           |
| EVM function calls             | Calling a function on a different contract will perform an EVM function call and switch the context such that state variables in the calling contract are inaccessible |
| Context switching              | The process of switching between different contract contexts when calling functions on different contracts                                                             |
| Persistent data                | Data that is stored on the Ethereum blockchain and persists even after the contract is executed                                                                        |
| Cron                           | There is no “cron” concept in Ethereum to call a function at a particular event automatically                                                                          |
| Use cases                      | Contracts can be used to implement various applications on the Ethereum blockchain, such as decentralized exchanges, token systems, and voting systems                 |
| Gas costs                      | Each contract function call requires a certain amount of gas to execute, which determines the cost of executing the contract                                           |
| Solidity compiler              | Contracts must be written in Solidity and compiled using the Solidity compiler before they can be deployed on the Ethereum network                                     |
| Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) | The runtime environment in which contracts are executed on the Ethereum network                                                                                        |
| Smart contracts                | Contracts that have programmable logic and can execute automatically without the need for human intervention                                                           |
| Decentralization               | Contracts on the Ethereum network are decentralized and run on a network of nodes instead of a central server                                                          |
| Security                       | Contracts must be designed with security in mind to avoid vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks and integer overflows                                             |
