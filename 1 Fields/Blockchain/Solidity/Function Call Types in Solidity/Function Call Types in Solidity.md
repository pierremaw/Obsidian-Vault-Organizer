# External call

An external call is a function call that is made from outside the contract. When an external call is made, a new transaction is created and sent to the contract with the function call encoded in the transaction data. External calls are used to interact with other contracts or to send ether to a contract.

# Internal call

An internal call is a function call that is made within the same contract. When an internal call is made, the function is executed directly in the same execution context as the calling function, without creating a new transaction. Internal calls are used to break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable parts.
