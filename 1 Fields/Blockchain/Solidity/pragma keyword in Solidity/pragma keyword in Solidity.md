Specifies the solidity compiler version that should be used to compile a given contract.

A typical `pragma` statement in Solidity looks like this:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```

This statement specifies that the contract should be compiled using the Solidity compiler version 0.8.0 or higher, but less than version 0.9.0. The `^` symbol is used to indicate that any compatible version of the compiler between 0.8.0 and 0.9.0 can be used.

The `pragma` statement must appear at the beginning of a Solidity contract file, before any other statements or declarations. It is used to ensure that the contract is compiled correctly, and to prevent compatibility issues with future versions.
