```
selfdestruct(address payable recipient);
```

- `selfdestruct` is a function in Solidity that allows a contract to destroy itself.
- The function takes one argument, which is the address of the recipient of any remaining ether in the contract after it is destroyed.
- The recipient address must be specified as a payable address, meaning it can receive ether.
- When `selfdestruct` is called, the contract's bytecode is cleared, making the contract unable to respond to any further calls or transactions.
- Any remaining ether in the contract is refunded to the designated recipient.
- Care should be taken when using `selfdestruct`, as future ether transfers to the contract address may be locked forever. It may be safer to use other methods of contract design and management to prevent unwanted calls or transactions.
