| Receive Ether Function      | A contract can have at most one receive function, which is executed on a call to the contract with empty calldata. It is declared using receive() external payable { ... } and can be virtual, can override and can have modifiers. If no receive function exists, but a payable fallback function exists, the fallback function will be called on a plain Ether transfer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fallback Function           | A contract can have at most one fallback function, which is executed on a call to the contract if none of the other functions match the given function signature, or if no data was supplied at all and there is no receive Ether function. It must have external visibility and can be virtual, can override and can have modifiers. If the function is marked payable, it can also receive Ether. If the version with parameters is used, input will contain the full data sent to the contract and can return data in output. The fallback function can execute complex operations as long as there is enough gas passed on to it. |
| Gas Limitations             | Both the receive and fallback functions have gas limitations, with the receive function only able to rely on 2300 gas being available and the fallback function with a worst-case gas limit of 2300 if it is also marked as payable. Writing to storage, creating a contract, calling an external function which consumes a large amount of gas, or sending Ether will consume more gas than the 2300 gas stipend. It is recommended to always define a receive Ether function to distinguish Ether transfers from interface confusions.                                                                                              |
| Implementation              | To decode the input data in the fallback function, the first four bytes can be checked for the function selector and then abi.decode can be used with the array slice syntax to decode ABI-encoded data. This should only be used as a last resort and proper functions should be used instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
