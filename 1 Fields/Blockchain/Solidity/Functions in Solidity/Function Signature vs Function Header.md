In Solidity, the terms "function signature" and "function header" are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to the line of code that defines a function's inputs and outputs, including its name, visibility, parameters, and return type.

However, it's worth noting that there is a subtle difference between the two terms.

The "function signature" refers specifically to the unique identifier of a function, which is a combination of the function name and its parameter types. The function signature is used to identify the function in the Solidity bytecode and in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It's what other contracts use to call the function on your contract.

The "function header" refers to the entire line of code that defines the function's inputs and outputs, including the function signature, the function name, visibility (e.g. public, private, external), the return type (if any), and the function parameters.

So, while the terms are often used interchangeably, the function signature is a specific part of the function header.
