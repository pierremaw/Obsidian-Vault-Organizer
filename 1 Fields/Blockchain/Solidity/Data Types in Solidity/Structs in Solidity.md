## Overview

-   **Solidity**: A smart contract programming language
-   **Structs**: User-defined data structures in Solidity

## Struct Declaration

-   **Syntax**: Defining structs using `struct` keyword
-   **Components**: Combining variables of different data types

## Struct Instantiation

-   **Creation**: Initializing a struct instance with specific values
-   **Assignment**: Assigning values to struct members

## Struct Storage

-   **Contract Storage**: Structs stored persistently in blockchain
-   **Memory**: Structs stored temporarily during contract execution

## Struct Usage

-   **Functions**: Structs used as function input or output parameters
-   **Arrays**: Structs used within arrays or mappings for complex data structures

## Best Practices

-   **Naming Convention**: Clear and descriptive names for structs and their members
-   **Modularity**: Encapsulating related data within structs for easier maintenance

```
A Solidity struct is declared using this format: 

struct name {
	type variableName;
	type variableName;  
 }
```
