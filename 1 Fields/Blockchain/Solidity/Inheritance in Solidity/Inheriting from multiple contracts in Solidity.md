**Inheritance** is a way to create a new contract based on another contract that is already present. The derived contract inherits its properties and methods from the base contract.

| Inheritance                 | A way to create a new contract that is based on an existing contract, inheriting its properties and methods                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Multiple Inheritance        | The ability to inherit from multiple contracts in a single derived contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Syntax                      | contract DerivedContract is BaseContract1, BaseContract2 {...}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Order of Inheritance        | The order of inheritance matters, as it determines which functions and variables are inherited in case of naming conflicts                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Diamond Inheritance Problem | A problem that arises when a derived contract inherits from multiple contracts that share a common base contract, resulting in ambiguous function calls and multiple copies of state variables                                                                                                           |
| super Keyword               | Used to call functions or access variables from a parent contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Function Overriding         | A feature that allows a derived contract to override a function from a parent contract with its own implementation                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| override Keyword            | Used to indicate that a function in a derived contract is intended to override a function from a parent contract                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Use Case                    | Inheriting from multiple contracts can be useful for combining functionality from different contracts, creating more modular and reusable code, and for implementing complex systems such as ERC-721 non-fungible tokens and DeFi protocols that require access to multiple interfaces and functionality |
