The Uniswap protocol uses a constant product market maker formula, which determines the price of an asset in a pool based on the ratio of the quantities of the two assets in the pool.

In the case of a pool with two assets, the formula is:

`Price = sqrt(price0 * price1)`

where `price0` is the price of the first asset and `price1` is the price of the second asset.
