`ISwapRouter` is an interface for a contract that provides token swapping functionality in Uniswap V3. It’s part of the `v3-periphery` repository on GitHub and is located in the `contracts/interfaces` directory[web_page].

The interface defines functions for swapping tokens via Uniswap V3. It also imports another interface called `IUniswapV3SwapCallback`, which is used to define a callback function that can be called during a swap[web_page].

The code for `ISwapRouter` was last updated by Connor Martin on April 6th, 2021 with commit 764903f[web_page]. This interface provides developers with a way to interact with Uniswap V3 and perform token swaps within their own contracts[web_page].
