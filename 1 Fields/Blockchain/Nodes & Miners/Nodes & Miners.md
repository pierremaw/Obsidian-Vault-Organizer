A **node** validates transactions and blocks.

A **miner** mines blocks that contain transactions.

All miners are nodes but not all nodes are miners.

___

Nodes validate new transactions and blocks according to network rules. Each node has their own copy of the blockchain.

A node can be either 
- **full**: stores the entire blockchain
- **light**: only stores a subset of the blockchain

A miner is a network participant that creates new blocks by solving a cryptographic puzzle that requires computational power. A miner receives a reward for finding a valid block, which consists of newly minted coins and transaction fees.
