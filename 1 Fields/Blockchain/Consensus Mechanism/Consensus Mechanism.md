_Consensus_ means coming to a general agreement. **_Blockchain consensus_ typically means at least 51% of nodes are in agreement over the current global state of the network**. Consensus mechanisms end up simply being rules that a distributed + decentralized blockchain network follows in order to stay in agreement over what is considered valid. Remember that consensus mechanisms are inter-changeable and there are many out there that we have yet to cover, like proof-of-stake.

The main consensus rules for proof-of-work typically look like religious commandments:

-   You cannot double spend.
-   The "longest" chain will be the one the rest of the nodes accept as the one "true" chain, determined by a chain's cumulative work. Also known as **Nakamoto Consensus**.

Bitcoin being a blockchain network, use a consensus mechanism called **proof-of-work**. Ethereum was previously using proof of work but has since moved to **proof-of-stake**. We will not be covering proof of stake here (for now), but in the meantime you can learn more about this transition [here](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/ethereum-2-0-your-guide-for-2022#transitioning-to-proof-of-stake-2)
