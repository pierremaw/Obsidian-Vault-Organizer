Full nodes maintain a complete copy of the blockchain and are responsible for validating new blocks and transactions.

A full node on the Ethereum network typically includes the following components:

1. **Blockchain instance**: A full node maintains a complete copy of the Ethereum blockchain, which includes all transaction history and the current state of the network. The blockchain instance is responsible for validating new blocks that are added to the blockchain and updating the node's local copy of the blockchain.
2.  **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) instance**: The EVM is a virtual machine that runs smart contracts on the Ethereum network. A full node includes an instance of the EVM, which is used to execute smart contracts and validate transactions on the network.
3. **Mempool instance**: The mempool is a data structure that holds pending transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block. A full node maintains a local mempool instance, which is used to validate incoming transactions and broadcast them to other nodes on the network.

**Consensus Mechanisms**: Full nodes participate in the consensus process, which is the mechanism that ensures all nodes on the network agree on the current state of the blockchain.

**Smart Contract Execution**: Full nodes execute smart contracts and maintain a copy of the state of the network, which is essential for ensuring that all nodes have an up-to-date view of the network.

**Mining and Block Validation**: Full nodes are responsible for validating new blocks that are added to the blockchain, and some nodes participate in the mining process that generates new blocks and rewards miners with new ether.

**Requirements for Running a Full Node**: Running a full node requires a significant amount of storage space, processing power, and bandwidth, and users must ensure that their node is always up-to-date with the latest version of the software.

**Alternatives to Running a Full Node**: Users who do not wish to run a full node can use light nodes or SPV nodes, which do not store a complete copy of the blockchain but instead rely on other nodes to verify transactions and execute smart contracts.
