The _nonce_ is the number of transactions sent from a given address. 

Each time you send a transaction, the nonce value increases by `1`.

The nonce is an important tool for preventing replay attacks and ensuring the security of the Ethereum network. 

By requiring that each transaction has a unique nonce, the Ethereum network can be sure that no malicious actors are trying to re-use transactions to manipulate the network.

It is also important to note that the nonce is used by the Ethereum network to determine the order in which transactions are processed. Transactions with a lower nonce value are processed before transactions with a higher nonce value.
