The deployed contracts section in Remix is an important feature that allows developers to see the contracts they have deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. It displays information about each deployed contract, including its address, the bytecode, the application binary interface (ABI), and other metadata.

# Components

## Contract Name
The name of the deployed contract.

## Compiler
The version of the compiler used to compile the contract.

## Balance
The current balance of the contract in Ether.

## Address
The address of the deployed contract on the blockchain.

## Transaction Hash
The hash of the transaction that deployed the contract to the blockchain.

## Bytecode
The bytecode of the deployed contract. This is the compiled code that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## Application Binary Interface (ABI)
The Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a way to interact with the contract. It specifies the function signatures, inputs, and outputs of the contract's functions.

## Metadata
Additional information about the contract, such as the optimization level used during compilation.


# Operations & Applications

The deployed contracts section in Remix is useful for the following operations:

## Verification
Developers can use the deployed contracts section to verify that a contract has been successfully deployed to the blockchain.

## Interacting with Contracts
Developers can use the ABI information provided in the deployed contracts section to interact with their deployed contracts from within Remix or from external applications.

## Debugging
When debugging a contract, developers can use the deployed contracts section to inspect the current state of the contract, including its current balance and its address.
