| Constant State Variables    | State variables declared as constant cannot be modified after contract construction and their values must be fixed at compile-time. They are replaced with their respective value in the code and can allow for local optimizations. They are generally cheaper than immutable state variables.                                                                      |
| Immutable State Variables   | State variables declared as immutable cannot be modified after contract construction and their value can still be assigned at construction time. They are evaluated once at construction time and their value is copied to all the places in the code where they are accessed. Immutable state variables are generally more expensive than constant state variables. |
| File-Level Constants        | Constants declared at the file level are available to all contracts within the file and their values are copied to all places where they are accessed. They can only be of string or value types.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Gas Costs                   | Compared to regular state variables, constant and immutable state variables have much lower gas costs due to the way they are replaced and evaluated. Constant values can sometimes be cheaper than immutable values.                                                                                                                                                |
| Supported Types             | At this time, only strings (for constants) and value types are supported for constants and immutables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
