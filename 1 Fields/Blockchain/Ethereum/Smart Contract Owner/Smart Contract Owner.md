Smart contracts can be deployed using both an externally owned account (EOA) or another smart contract.

# EOA Deployment

When deploying a smart contract using an EOA, the transaction that deploys the contract is signed by the account's private key, and the contract is stored on the blockchain with an associated contract address.

# Smart Contract Deployment

When deploying a smart contract from another contract, the contract is instantiated using a contract creation transaction. This transaction includes the bytecode of the contract to be deployed, and the contract is stored on the blockchain with an associated contract address.

In both cases, the contract is deployed to the blockchain and can be accessed and interacted with by sending transactions to its address.
