In an Ethereum smart contract function definition statement, there are several possible inputs that can be included. These inputs include:

`function name`: A descriptive name for the function that accurately represents its purpose.

`parameters`: The inputs that the function will receive. These can be of various data types, such as `uint`, `address`, `string`, etc. The parameters are defined within parentheses and separated by commas. For example, `(uint x, string s)`.   

`visibility`: The visibility of the function, which determines who can access it. There are three visibility options in Solidity: `public`, `internal`, and `private`.
    
`modifier`: A special keyword in Solidity that allows you to add additional logic to a function. Modifiers can be used to change the behavior of a function or restrict access to it.
    
`returns`: The return type of the function. The function can return a single value or an array of values. The return type is defined within parentheses after the `returns` keyword. For example, `returns (uint)`.
