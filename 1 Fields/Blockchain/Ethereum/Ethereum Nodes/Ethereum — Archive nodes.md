A type of node in the Ethereum network that stores all historical state data, including old transactions and smart contracts, in addition to the current state.

Archive nodes play a critical role in ensuring the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.

# Components

**Data Storage**: Archive nodes store complete transaction history and smart contract information, including deleted information, in addition to the current state.
**Hardware Requirements**: Due to the large size of the data stored, archive nodes require high storage capacity, high processing power, and fast internet speeds.
**Node Synchronization**: Archive nodes need to sync with other nodes on the network, which can take several days due to the size of the data.

# Operations & Applications

**Data Analysis**: Archive nodes can be used to analyze historical data for research purposes.
**Blockchain Forensics**: Archive nodes are useful in blockchain forensics and investigations.
**Smart Contract Auditing**: Archive nodes enable thorough auditing of smart contracts by providing a complete record of past transactions and state changes.

# Additional Info

**Cost**: Archive nodes are expensive to run, both in terms of hardware and bandwidth costs.
**Decentralization**: The more archive nodes that exist on the network, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes.
**Specialization**: Running an archive node is a specialized task that requires a high level of technical expertise.
