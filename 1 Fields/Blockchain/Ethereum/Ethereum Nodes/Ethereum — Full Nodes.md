Full nodes are complete network nodes that download, verify, and enforce all of the rules of the Ethereum network. 

Full nodes are an important part of the Ethereum network, as they help maintain the security and integrity of the blockchain.

# Components

**Verification**: Full nodes verify transactions and blocks before accepting them. **Storage**: Full nodes store a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain. 
**Network Communication**: Full nodes communicate with other nodes in the Ethereum network.

# Operations & Applications

**Transaction Processing**: Full nodes process transactions, check their validity, and broadcast them to the network. 
**Mining**: Full nodes can mine new blocks, which is the process of adding new transactions to the Ethereum blockchain. 
**Smart Contract Execution**: Full nodes can execute smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Additional Info

**Security**: Full nodes provide a high level of security, as they can independently verify all transactions and blocks. 
**Bandwidth**: Running a full node requires significant bandwidth and storage capacity. **Syncing**: Initial syncing of a full node can take a significant amount of time.
