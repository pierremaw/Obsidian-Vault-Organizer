The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized naming system that maps human-readable domain names to Ethereum addresses. It allows users to register and manage domain names that can be used to identify Ethereum accounts, contracts, and other entities.

ENS address example:

```
mydomain.eth
```
