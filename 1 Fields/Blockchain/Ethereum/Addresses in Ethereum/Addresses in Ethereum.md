# Address Types

## 1. Externally Owned Account Address

An Ethereum account is a public/private key pair that is used to store and manage Ether and other tokens. Each account has a unique address on the EVM.

## 2. Smart Contract Address

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain. They can be written in Solidity or other programming languages, and are deployed to the EVM as a contract. Each contract is assigned a unique Ethereum address that is used to interact with it on the blockchain.
