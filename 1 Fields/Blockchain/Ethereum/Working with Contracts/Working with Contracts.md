### [Interacting with existing contracts](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/examples.html#id10)[](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/examples.html#interacting-with-existing-contracts "Permalink to this headline")

In order to use an existing contract, youâ€™ll need its deployed address and its ABI. Both can be found using block explorers, like Etherscan. Once you instantiate a contract instance, you can read data and execute transactions.

```python
# Configure w3, e.g., w3 = Web3(...)
address = '0x1f9840a85d5aF5bf1D1762F925BDADdC4201F988'
abi = '[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"},{"internalType":"address","name":"minter_","type":"address"},...'
contract_instance = w3.eth.contract(address=address, abi=abi)

# read state:
contract_instance.functions.storedValue().call()
# 42

# update state:
tx_hash = contract_instance.functions.updateValue(43).transact()
```
