Enums are used to represent a finite set of options, while structs are used to represent more complex data structures.

|               | Enums                                                          | Structs                                                      |

| Definition           | Enumerated set of values                                       | User-defined data structure                                  |
| Members              | Fixed set of named members                                     | Variable set of named members                                |
| Data types           | Enums are explicitly convertible to and from all integer types | Struct members can be of any data type                       |
| Value representation | Options are represented by subsequent unsigned integer values  | Structs are represented as a contiguous block of memory      |
| Range of values      | Enums have a limited range of values                           | Structs have a theoretically unlimited range of values       |
| Size                 | Limited to 256 members                                         | Size depends on the number and type of members in the struct |
| Storage location     | Enums are always stored in memory                              | Structs can be stored in memory or storage                   |
| Usage                | Used to represent a finite set of options                      | Used to represent more complex data structures               |
