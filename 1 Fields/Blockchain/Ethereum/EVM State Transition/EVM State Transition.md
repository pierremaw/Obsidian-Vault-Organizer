**What is an EVM state transition?**

An EVM state transition is a process in which the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) changes its state from one snapshot to another as a result of executing a transaction.

**Why does the EVM state need to transition?**

The EVM state needs to transition to reflect the changes caused by a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. For example, if a user sends some Ether to another account, the balances of the sender and receiver need to be updated. This is achieved through an EVM state transition.

**How does an EVM state transition work?**

When a transaction is executed on the Ethereum blockchain, the EVM takes the current state of the system and applies the changes specified in the transaction. This produces a new EVM state that reflects the updated balances of all accounts and the updated state of all smart contracts involved in the transaction.

The EVM state transition involves several steps, including:

1.  Input validation: The EVM checks that the transaction data is valid and has the correct format.
2.  Gas calculation: The EVM calculates the amount of gas needed to execute the transaction.
3.  Contract creation (if applicable): If the transaction creates a new smart contract, the EVM creates the contract and assigns it a new address.
4.  Execution: The EVM executes the transaction and updates the state of the affected accounts and contracts.
5.  Output generation: The EVM generates the output of the transaction, which may include events emitted by the smart contracts involved.
    

By following these steps, the EVM state transition ensures that the Ethereum blockchain remains secure and functional, with all updates being recorded in the blockchain's immutable ledger.
