# Step 1: Formulate the gas quantity

The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas you are willing to pay for your transaction to be processed. If your transaction requires more gas than the gas limit you set, the transaction will fail and you will lose the gas you paid.

The gas limit for a transaction can be estimated by simulating the transaction on a test network, such as Ropsten or Kovan. This can be done using a tool like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which allows you to write and test smart contracts in a web browser.

# Step 2: Formulate the gas price

The gas price is the amount of ether you are willing to pay per unit of gas. This determines the priority of your transaction, as miners are incentivized to process transactions with higher gas prices first.

The gas price can be obtained from a variety of sources, such as Ethereum gas price trackers like [GasNow](https://www.gasnow.org/) or [GasTracker](https://gascap.io/). These sites provide real-time information on gas prices on the Ethereum network.

# Step 3: Formulate the gas fee

Once you have determined the gas limit and gas price for your transaction, you can calculate the total gas fee. The gas fee is simply the product of the gas limit and gas price.

```python
gas_limit = 21000  # example gas limit
gas_price = 50  # example gas price in gwei
gas_fee = gas_limit * gas_price * 10**9  # convert from gwei to wei
print(f"Gas Fee: {gas_fee} wei")

```
This code example calculates the gas fee for a transaction with a gas limit of 21000 and a gas price of 50 gwei. The gas fee is calculated by multiplying the gas limit and gas price, and converting the result from gwei to wei.

# Step 4: Adjust for network state

The gas price on the Ethereum network can vary widely depending on network congestion. During times of high demand, the gas price can increase significantly, while during times of low demand, the gas price can decrease.
