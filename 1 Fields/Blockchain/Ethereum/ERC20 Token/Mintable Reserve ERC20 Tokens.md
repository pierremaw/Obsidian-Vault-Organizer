# AAVE

Aave is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend various crypto assets. Aave uses mintable reserve ERC20 tokens to represent the underlying assets that are deposited into its protocol. These tokens are called aTokens, and they accrue interest in real time according to the supply and demand of the market. For example, if a user deposits DAI into Aave, they will receive aDAI tokens that can be redeemed for DAI plus interest at any time.

Mintable reserve ERC20 tokens are a type of ERC20 tokens that have a non-fixed total supply, meaning that the token owner can create new tokens at any time and add them to the overall supply. This feature allows Aave to mint new aTokens whenever users deposit assets into the protocol, and burn them whenever users withdraw their assets. Mintable reserve ERC20 tokens also have a disable minting method, which can be used to stop the minting process completely if needed.

Mintable reserve ERC20 tokens are useful for Aave because they allow users to earn passive income on their deposits without losing liquidity or control over their funds. Users can also use their aTokens as collateral for borrowing other assets from Aave, creating more opportunities for leverage and arbitrage. Mintable reserve ERC20 tokens also enable composability with other DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap or Compound, where users can swap or lend their aTokens for other tokens.
