An Ethereum account is an address on the Ethereum blockhain.

Ethereum accounts are used to interact with the Ethereum network.

An account can be controlled by a private key or a smart contract.

___ 
# nonce
A number used once for authentication or transaction identification.

# balance
Amount of ether in an Ethereum account.

# codeHash
Hash of contract code for identification.

# storageRoot

Sometimes known as a storage hash. A 256-bit hash of the root node of a Merkle Patricia trie that encodes the storage contents of the account (a mapping between 256-bit integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer values. This trie encodes the hash of the storage contents of this account, and is empty by default.

# Operations

**Sending Transactions**: Ethereum accounts can send transactions to other accounts, smart contracts, or decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. 
**Signing Transactions**: Ethereum accounts use their private keys to digitally sign transactions to prove their authenticity and authorization. 
**Gas Fee Payment**: Transactions on the Ethereum network require a gas fee payment in order to execute. 
**Smart Contract Interactions**: Contract accounts can interact with smart contracts to trigger functions and modify state.
