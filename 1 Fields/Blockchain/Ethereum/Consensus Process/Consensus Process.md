1. Transactions are broadcast to the network.
2. Miners pick up the transactions and try to create a block by solving a cryptographic puzzle.
3. Once a miner successfully solves the puzzle, it broadcasts the new block to the network.
4. Other nodes in the network receive the new block and verify it by checking that the transactions are valid, and the block was correctly solved.
5. If the block is valid, the other nodes will add it to their copy of the blockchain and broadcast the new chain to their peers.
6. The network continues to validate and add new blocks to the chain, creating a distributed, immutable ledger of transactions.

This process is repeated continuously, creating a constantly evolving consensus state. It is important to note that the consensus state is not reached at a specific point in time, but rather is a constantly evolving and changing state.
