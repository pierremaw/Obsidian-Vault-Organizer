**Inheritance**Â is a way to reuse code in Solidity. Inheritance allows you to create "child" contracts that inherit all the code from a "parent" contract. This lets developers avoid duplicating code and makes smart contract maintenance much easier.

Inheritance is an important concept in object-oriented programming, and it's one of the things that makes Solidity so powerful. Learning how to to create standardized contracts that can be easily extended and modified is an important Solidity lesson to master.
