Function definitions for external contract interactions.

___

A function signature in Solidity refers to the unique identifier for a function, which is determined by the function name, parameter types, and return types.

When creating an interface in Solidity, the function signatures of the functions in the contract being interacted with must be defined. The function signature includes the function name, parameter types, and return types, and is declared in the interface without any implementation.

Here is an example that shows a Solidity interface defining a contract's function signatures:

```solidity
interface MyContractInterface {
    function myFunction(uint256 myParam) external returns (bool);
}
```


In this example, the interface `MyContractInterface` is defining a single function with the name `myFunction` that takes in a single parameter of type `uint256` and returns a boolean value. The `external` keyword specifies the visibility of the function, which in this case means that the function can only be called from outside of the contract.

### Using Function Signatures

Once the interface has been defined, it can be used to interact with the contract that implements the functions. The implementation contract must have the same function signatures as defined in the interface in order for the interaction to be successful.

Here is an example that shows how to use a function signature from an interface to interact with a contract:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    function myFunction(uint256 myParam) public returns (bool) {
        // function implementation
    }
}

contract MyContractConsumer {
    MyContractInterface myContract;

    constructor(address _contractAddress) {
        myContract = MyContractInterface(_contractAddress);
    }

    function callMyFunction(uint256 myParam) public {
        bool result = myContract.myFunction(myParam);
        // use the result of the function call
    }
}
```

In this example, the contract `MyContract` is implementing the `myFunction` function with the same signature as defined in the `MyContractInterface`. The contract `MyContractConsumer` then calls the function `myFunction` on the `myContract` instance of the interface, passing in the required parameter. The result of the function call is then stored in the `result` variable, which can be used for further logic.
