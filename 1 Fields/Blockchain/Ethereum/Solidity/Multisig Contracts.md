A **multisig contract** is a type of contract that requires more than one signature to execute its code. Solidity multisig contracts are useful when developers want to require multiple people to approve a transaction before it is executed.

Multisig contracts are also useful for cases where developers want to limit the amount of money that can be spent in a certain period of time. For example, you could use a multisig contract to require two signatures for any transaction over $1,000.
