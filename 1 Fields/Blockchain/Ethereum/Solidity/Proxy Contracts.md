A **proxy contract** is a type of contract that allows another contract to execute its code. Solidity proxy contracts are useful for cases where you want to upgrade a contract but don't want to redeploy it.

Proxy contracts are also useful when developers want to execute a contract's code on a different blockchain. For example, you could use a proxy contract to execute a Solidity contract on an Ethereum testnet.
