The ["require"](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-require) keyword is one of three special functions: _require_, _assert_, and _revert_. Require checks if a condition is true, and if not, it will revert the transaction and return an error message.

Using _require_ allows you to prevent errors from happening in your contract. For example, you could use _require_ to check that a user has enough balance to make a purchase, or that an address is valid before sending a transaction.
