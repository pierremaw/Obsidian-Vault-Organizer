Keccak256 is a cryptographic hash function that is used to map data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size hash value.

The Keccak-256 hash function is used extensively in Ethereum smart contracts to generate a unique identifier for a piece of data or a transaction. The `keccak256` function in Vyper is a built-in function that takes in a message as an input and produces a Keccak-256 hash.
