An interface is used for contract to contract interaction.

At a high level, an interface is simply a list of function names with their inputs and outputs. Whenever a smart contract intends to execute the function of another smart contract, it does so through the interface. The compiler will check that the function is being called correctly, with the appropriate inputs, and that any stored output of that function is done correctly within the original smart contract.
