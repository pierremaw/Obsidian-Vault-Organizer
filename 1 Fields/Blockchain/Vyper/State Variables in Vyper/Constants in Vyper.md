Constants are variables that cannot change.


# **Declare a Constant**

To declare a constant in Vyper, you simply need to define a variable at the contract top with the **`constant`** modifier. Here is an example:

```
MY_CONSTANT: constant(uint256) = 123
```

In this example, we have declared a constant called **`MY_CONSTANT`** of type **`uint256`** and initialized it with a value of **`123`**. The **`constant`** modifier indicates that this value will not change throughout the execution of the contract.
