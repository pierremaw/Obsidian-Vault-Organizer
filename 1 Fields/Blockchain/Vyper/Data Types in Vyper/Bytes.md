In Vyper, `bytes` is a dynamic byte array type that can store an arbitrary number of bytes. It is similar to a `string` type in Python. The `bytes` type is mutable, meaning that the length of the array can be changed and elements can be added, removed, or modified.

To declare a `bytes` variable in Vyper, you can use the following syntax:

```vyper
my_bytes: bytes
```

You can also initialize a `bytes` variable with a value like this:

```vyper
my_bytes: bytes = b"hello world"
```

Here, the `b` prefix indicates that the string should be treated as a sequence of bytes.

You can access individual bytes in a `bytes` variable using the square bracket syntax:

```vyper
my_bytes[0]  # gets the first byte of the bytes array 
my_bytes[-1]  # gets the last byte of the bytes array
```

You can also perform various operations on `bytes` variables, such as concatenation, slicing, and checking membership:

```vyper
my_bytes + b"!"  # concatenates the bytes with a "!" character my_bytes[2:7]  # gets a slice of bytes from index 2 to 6 b"h" in my_bytes  # checks if the bytes contain the byte value for "h"
```
