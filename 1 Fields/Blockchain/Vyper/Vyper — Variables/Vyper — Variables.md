name: visibility(type)
```

Where `name` is the name of the variable, `visibility` is an optional keyword that specifies the variable's visibility (e.g., `public`, `private`, `internal`), and `type` is the type of data that the variable can hold (e.g., `int128`, `uint256`, `bool`, `address`).

The visibility keyword determines who can access the variable. If a variable is declared as `public`, it can be accessed by anyone on the blockchain, while a `private` variable can only be accessed from within the same contract.
