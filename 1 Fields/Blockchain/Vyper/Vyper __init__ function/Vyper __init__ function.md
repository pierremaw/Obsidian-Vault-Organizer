In Vyper, the `__init__` function is a special function that is executed only once when the contract is first created. It is similar to a constructor in other programming languages. The purpose of the `__init__` function is to set the initial state of the contract and initialize any variables or data structures.

When a new contract is created, the `__init__` function is automatically called by the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and any initial state changes made in the function are permanently recorded on the blockchain.

It is worth noting that in Vyper, you are not required to define an `__init__` function in your contract. However, if you do not define one, the contract will have no state and will not be able to store any data.
