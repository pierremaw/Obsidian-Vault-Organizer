# Main Components

**Miners**: Participants in the blockchain network who perform the computational work to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain.
**Transactions**: The transfer of value or data on the blockchain network.
**Market conditions**: The current state of the market, including supply and demand, and the price of assets.
**Protocol rules**: The rules and regulations that govern the operation of the blockchain network.

# Operations

**Arbitrages**: 97% come from arbitrages. Namely, arbitragers exploiting the price differences among different DEX protocols (Uniswap, Sushiswap, Balancer).
**Front-running**: A strategy where miners prioritize their own transactions over others, taking advantage of their knowledge of upcoming transactions to make a profit.
**Back-running**: A strategy where miners delay the processing of transactions that they know will drive up the price of a certain asset, and then take advantage of the increased price to make a profit.
**Sandwich attacks**: A strategy where miners insert their own transactions between two conflicting transactions, taking advantage of the resolution of the conflict to make a profit.

# Applications

**Arbitrage**: Taking advantage of differences in prices between different markets to make a profit.
**Liquidity provision**: Providing liquidity to a market by buying and selling assets to help maintain market stability.
**Trading**: Buying and selling assets for profit.
