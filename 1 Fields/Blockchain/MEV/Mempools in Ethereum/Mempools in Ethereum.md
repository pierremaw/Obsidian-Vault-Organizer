Each node on the Ethereum network has its own unique mempool, which represents the collection of unconfirmed transactions that it has received from other nodes. While all nodes will have some overlap in their mempools due to the fact that they are processing transactions on the same network, each node's mempool is ultimately private to that node and does not necessarily reflect the state of other nodes' mempools.
