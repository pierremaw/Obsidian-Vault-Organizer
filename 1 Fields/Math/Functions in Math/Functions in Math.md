# Functions in Math

![[Functions in Math.png|200]]

* **Functions**: Rule that assigns output values to input values, single output per input
    * **Domain**: Set of all possible input values, independent variable's range
    * **Range**: Set of all possible output values, dependent variable's scope
    * **Function Notation**: Denotes function as f(x), where x is the input, f(x) is the output

* **Linear Functions**: Functions with a constant rate of change, represented by f(x) = mx + b
    * **Slope**: Steepness of the linear function, defined as rise over run
    * **Y-intercept**: Point where the function intersects the y-axis, b in f(x) = mx + b

* **Polynomial Functions**: Functions of the form f(x) = a_nx^n + a_(n-1)x^(n-1) + ... + a_0
    * **Degree**: Highest exponent of the polynomial, determines function's behavior
    * **Roots**: Input values (x) that make the function equal zero, solve for x in f(x) = 0

* **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions involving angles, e.g., sine, cosine, tangent
    * **Sine (sin)**: Ratio of opposite side to hypotenuse in a right triangle
    * **Cosine (cos)**: Ratio of adjacent side to hypotenuse in a right triangle
    * **Tangent (tan)**: Ratio of opposite side to adjacent side in a right triangle

* **Exponential Functions**: Functions with a constant raised to the power of the input, f(x) = a^x
    * **Growth/Decay**: Exponential increase/decrease in output, a > 1 for growth, 0 < a < 1 for decay
    * **Base**: Constant factor, denoted as 'a' in the function f(x) = a^x

* **Logarithmic Functions**: Functions that are the inverse of exponential functions, f(x) = log_a(x)
    * **Base**: Corresponds to the base of the related exponential function, denoted as 'a'
    * **Natural Logarithm**: Logarithm with base e, denoted as ln(x) or log_e(x)
