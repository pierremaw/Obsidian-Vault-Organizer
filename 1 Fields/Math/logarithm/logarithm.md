How many base values do we need to get the input value?

-  **Logarithm**: Inverse function to exponentiation.
-   **Base**: Positive number other than 1, e.g. 10 or e.
-   **Common logarithm**: Logarithm with base 10, written as log(x).
-   **Natural logarithm**: Logarithm with base e, written as ln(x).
-   **Product rule**: logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y).
-   **Quotient rule**: logb(x/y) = logb(x) - logb(y).
-   **Change of base rule**: logb(x) = loga(x)/loga(b).

```

# log x with base b
log_b(x) = y

# rule
log_b(x) = y if and only if b^y = x

# log 100 with base 10
log_10(100) = 2


```
