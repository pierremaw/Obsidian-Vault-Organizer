- **Derivative**: a measure of how much a function changes as its input changes.
- **Instantaneous rate of change**: is the derivative of a function at a specific point.
- **Slope of the tangent line**: is the derivative of a function at a point on its graph.
- **Differential calculus**: is the branch of mathematics that studies derivatives.
- **Applications of derivatives**: include finding the slope of a tangent line, finding the area under a curve, and solving differential equations.
- **Derivatives are used in many fields**: physics, engineering, finance.
