Math that relates to change and motion.

# Differential Calculus

Rates of change
Slopes of curves

## Derivatives

**A derivative**: Measures how a function changes as its input changes.
It is the rate of change of a function, and is denoted by the symbol d/dx. Derivatives are used in a wide range of applications, including optimization, physics, and engineering.

## Differentiation

Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function. There are a number of rules and techniques for differentiating functions, including the power rule, the product rule, and the chain rule.

# Integral Calculus

integral calculus deals with the accumulation of quantities and areas under curves.

## Integrals

An integral is a way of measuring the area under a curve. It is denoted by the symbol âˆ«, and is used in a wide range of applications, including physics, engineering, and economics. Integrals are used to calculate the total change in a quantity over time, or the total area or volume of a region.

## Integration

Integration is the process of finding the integral of a function. There are a number of rules and techniques for integrating functions, including the power rule, integration by substitution, and integration by parts.

# Limits

At the heart of calculus is the concept of limits. A limit is the value that a function approaches as the input gets closer and closer to a particular value. Limits are essential for understanding continuity, derivatives, and integrals.
