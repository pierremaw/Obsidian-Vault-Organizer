| Scalability | Infura is designed to be highly scalable, allowing developers to easily handle large volumes of traffic and transactions. It uses distributed infrastructure to ensure that requests are processed quickly and efficiently.                             |
| Reliability | Infura is known for its high level of reliability, with a service uptime of over 99.9%. It uses redundant architecture and failover mechanisms to ensure that services are always available.                                                            |
