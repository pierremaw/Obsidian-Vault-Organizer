Interacting with a smart contracts is an asynchronous operation. Therefore, most APIs and libraries use JavaScript's Promise for returning values.

We can divide smart contract interaction into two categories: Read values and Write values.

Read values do not incur a transaction cost and can generally be read from the blockchain without the need for a wallet.

Write values are attributes that require the correct composition, signing, and submission of a transaction to the blockchain.
