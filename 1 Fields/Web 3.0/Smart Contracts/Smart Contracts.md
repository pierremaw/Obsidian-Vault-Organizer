A smart contract is a computer program that runs on a blockchain network.

| Feature        | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decentralization                   | Smart contracts enable decentralization by running on a blockchain network, which removes the need for intermediaries and centralized control.                  |
| Immutability                       | Smart contracts are immutable, meaning that once they are deployed on the blockchain, they cannot be altered or deleted.                                        |
| Self-execution                     | Smart contracts are self-executing, meaning that they automatically execute when certain conditions are met.                                                    |
| Trustless execution                | Smart contracts enable trustless execution, as they operate on predefined rules and are transparent to all participants on the network.                         |
| Distributed ledger                 | Smart contracts operate on a distributed ledger, which provides an immutable record of all transactions and changes made to the contract.                       |
| Tokenization                       | Smart contracts can be used to create and manage tokens, such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and security tokens.                             |
| Decentralized applications (Dapps) | Smart contracts can be used to build Dapps, which are decentralized applications that run on a blockchain network.                                              |
| Automated transactions             | Smart contracts can be used to automate transactions, such as payments, trades, and other financial transactions, based on predefined rules and conditions.     |
| Transparency                       | Smart contracts are transparent, as they are visible to all participants on the blockchain network, providing a high degree of transparency and accountability. |
| Cost-efficiency                    | Smart contracts can reduce transaction costs by removing intermediaries and streamlining processes.                                                             |
