| Proxy contract              | A proxy contract is a contract that acts as an intermediary between a user and a logic contract. The proxy contract receives function calls from the user and forwards them to the logic contract.                                                                                                                                   |
| Logic contract              | A logic contract is a contract that contains the functionality of a smart contract. It is separated from the proxy contract to enable contract upgrades without modifying the storage or interface of the contract.                                                                                                                  |
| Separation of concerns      | Separating the proxy and logic contracts allows for better separation of concerns, as the proxy contract can focus on handling user interactions and the logic contract can focus on implementing the core functionality of the smart contract.                                                                                      |
| Contract upgradeability     | Separating the proxy and logic contracts enables contract upgradeability without losing the storage and interface of the contract. A new logic contract can be deployed and the address of the logic contract can be updated in the proxy contract to enable upgrades without affecting the user interface or state of the contract. |
| EIP-1967                    | EIP-1967 is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal that proposes a standard for implementing upgradeable contracts using proxy and logic contracts. It specifies the storage layout and functions required for the proxy contract and logic contract to interact with each other.                                                          |
| Implementation details      | When creating proxy and logic contracts, it is important to consider implementation details such as handling function return values, managing the state of the contract, and ensuring that the interface of the contract remains consistent after upgrades.                                                                          |
| Security considerations     | When creating proxy and logic contracts, it is important to consider security considerations such as access control, preventing reentrancy attacks, and protecting against malicious logic contracts.                                                                                                                                |
| Gas optimization            | Creating proxy and logic contracts can be more gas-efficient than deploying a new contract for each upgrade, as the storage and interface of the contract remain unchanged between upgrades.                                                                                                                                         |
