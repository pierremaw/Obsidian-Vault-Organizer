**Stargate**: is a **fully composable native asset bridge** with unified liquidity and instant guaranteed finality built on top of **LayerZero**. Stargate's vision is to make cross-chain liquidity transfer a seamless, single transaction process.

**LayerZero**: is a generic messaging protocol or transport layer, which provides a powerful, low level communication primitive upon which a diverse set of cross-chain applications can be built. Stargate is a bridge built on top of LayerZero, thus Stargate utilizes LayerZero in every message sent.
