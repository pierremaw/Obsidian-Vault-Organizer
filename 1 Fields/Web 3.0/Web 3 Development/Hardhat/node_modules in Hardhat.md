| Package management             | The node_modules folder is where all the external packages and dependencies required by your Hardhat project are stored.                                                                                                    |
| Local installation             | When you install a package using npm or yarn, it is downloaded and installed into the node_modules folder in your project directory.                                                                                        |
| Version control                | The node_modules folder is typically not included in version control systems like Git, as it can be regenerated by running npm install or yarn install based on the package.json file.                                      |
| package.json                   | The package.json file in your Hardhat project lists all the installed packages and their versions, as well as any scripts or configuration settings for your project.                                                       |
| Dependency resolution          | The node_modules folder allows Hardhat to resolve dependencies between packages and ensure that they are installed and configured correctly.                                                                                |
| Task execution                 | Hardhat uses the packages in the node_modules folder to execute its tasks and scripts, such as compiling contracts, running tests, and deploying contracts.                                                                 |
| Package updates                | You can use npm or yarn to update packages in the node_modules folder to the latest version or a specific version specified in the package.json file.                                                                       |
| Package management tools       | Hardhat works with various package management tools, including npm, yarn, and pnpm, to manage the packages and dependencies in the node_modules folder.                                                                     |
| Optimizing packages            | You can use tools like npm audit or yarn audit to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the packages installed in the node_modules folder.                                                                                    |
| Performance optimization       | The node_modules folder can affect the performance of your Hardhat project, so it's important to keep it optimized and properly configured.                                                                                 |
| Debugging                      | In some cases, issues with packages or dependencies installed in the node_modules folder can cause problems in your Hardhat project. Debugging these issues may require inspecting the contents of the node_modules folder. |
| Package management conventions | Hardhat follows standard package management conventions to ensure that packages and dependencies are installed and configured correctly in the node_modules folder.                                                         |
