| Definition | Automated tests to verify the functionality and correctness of smart contracts.                                                                                                   |
| Purpose    | Ensure code quality and prevent potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.                                                                                                     |
| Tools      | Hardhat, Mocha, Chai, Waffle, ethers.js, and more.                                                                                                                                |
| Types      | Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.                                                                                                                              |
| Syntax     | Tests are written in JavaScript and use specific libraries and frameworks.                                                                                                        |
| Components | Test cases, assertions, hooks, and other testing tools.                                                                                                                           |
| Examples   | Testing contract deployment, function execution, event emission, and more.                                                                                                        |
| Benefits   | Provides automated testing for improved code quality and security, facilitates faster development cycles, and ensures compatibility between different platforms and environments. |
