| Project setup            | Hardhat projects are Node.js projects with the hardhat package installed and a hardhat.config.js file. To initialize a Node.js project, you can use npm or yarn. We recommend using npm 7 or later. After initializing the project, you need to install Hardhat using npm or yarn.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Hardhat options          | After installing Hardhat, run npx hardhat to see the options for facilitating project creation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Sample Hardhat project   | If you select Create a JavaScript project, a simple project creation wizard will ask you some questions. After that, the wizard will create some directories and files and install the necessary dependencies. The most important of these dependencies is the Hardhat Toolbox, a plugin that bundles all the things you need to start working with Hardhat. The initialized project has default paths for contracts/, scripts/, test/, and hardhat.config.js. |
| Testing                  | Hardhat provides the built-in Hardhat Network as the development network to test on, along with the Hardhat Network Helpers library to manipulate this network. Mocha is the test runner, Chai is the assertion library, and the Hardhat Chai Matchers extend Chai with contracts-related functionality. The ethers.js library is also available to interact with the network and with contracts.                                                              |
| External networks        | If you need to use an external network, like an Ethereum testnet, mainnet or some other specific node software, you can set it up using the networks configuration entries in the exported object in hardhat.config.js. You can make use of the --network CLI parameter to quickly change the network.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Plugins and dependencies | Most of Hardhat's functionality comes from plugins, so check out the plugins section for the official list and see if there are any ones of interest to you. To use a plugin, the first step is always to install it using npm or yarn, followed by requiring it in your config file.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Setting up your editor   | Hardhat for Visual Studio Code is the official Hardhat extension that adds advanced support for Solidity to VSCode. If you use Visual Studio Code, give it a try!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
