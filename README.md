# Organize Vault Structure Module

This Python module is designed to organize and manage the structure of a vault, which is a collection of memo files. The module provides several functions to manipulate and organize these files based on their metadata and types.

## Functions

### `update_memo_variables(vault_path)`
Updates global dictionaries with memo file paths, metadata, types, and folder paths. 
- **Arguments**: 
  - `vault_path`: Path to the vault directory.

### `organize_vault_structure(root_dir)`
Organizes the vault structure by moving files to their respective folders based on their type and metadata. 
- **Arguments**: 
  - `root_dir`: Root directory of the vault.

### `update_topics(memo_file_paths, memo_file_meta_data)`
Updates topics for the provided memo files. It iterates over the provided memo files and updates their topics by calling the `topic_search` function. 
- **Arguments**: 
  - `memo_file_paths`: Dictionary containing the paths of the memo files.
  - `memo_file_meta_data`: Dictionary containing metadata for the memo files.

### `delete_circular_topics_call(memo_file_paths, memo_file_meta_data)`
Removes circular topics from the provided memo files. It iterates over the provided memo files and deletes circular topics by calling the `delete_circular_topics` function. 
- **Arguments**: 
  - `memo_file_paths`: Dictionary containing the paths of the memo files.
  - `memo_file_meta_data`: Dictionary containing metadata for the memo files.

### `delete_empty_folders(memo_folder_paths)`
Deletes empty folders from the vault, excluding specified protected folders. It traverses the vault and deletes folders if they are empty, with the exception of paths provided in `CORE_FOLDERS`. 
- **Arguments**: 
  - `memo_folder_paths`: List containing the paths of the folders to check.

## Usage

The main functions are called at the end of the module:

```python
# Example code calling the functions
update_memo_variables('/path/to/vault')
organize_vault_structure('/path/to/vault/root')
update_topics(memo_paths_dict, memo_metadata_dict)
delete_circular_topics_call(memo_paths_dict, memo_metadata_dict)
delete_empty_folders(memo_folder_list)
